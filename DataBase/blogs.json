  "title": "The 3 Best WordPress Hosting Providers in 2023",
  "content": "<h2><strong>WHAT DIFFERENT KINDS OF WORDPRESS HOSTING ARE THERE?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>As mentioned above, there are different kinds of WordPress hosting – free, shared, dedicated server, VPS, and managed.</p><p>The first of these,&nbsp;<strong>free web hosting</strong>, is basically what it says on the tin. Normally, free WordPress Hosting is offered in small groups or online forums managed by people who are reselling part of their server space.&nbsp;</p><p>Free hosting may sound great, but there’s usually a catch. Often, you have to include banner ads or text in the footer of your sites. Most importantly, though, free hosting is typically unreliable – the providers can leave you hanging at any time.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Shared WordPress Hosting&nbsp;</strong>is the most common type of web hosting for people who are just launching their sites. It’s affordable and gives you a good technical basis.&nbsp;</p><p>Shared hosting means that providers use the same server for multiple sites. This allows them to offer their services at budget-friendly rates. The downside is that you may have to upgrade your hosting plan if your site takes up too much of their server space.&nbsp;</p><p>Next up,&nbsp;<strong>VPS Hosting&nbsp;</strong>stands for web hosting via Virtual Private Servers. In this approach, a physical server is partitioned into multiple servers, which allows individual users a greater amount of freedom. If you have the technical know-how, you can configure it to run specific software and install system upgrades.&nbsp;</p><p>Do you have solid technical knowledge and want a maximum of control? Then&nbsp;<strong>dedicated server hosting&nbsp;</strong>may be the best choice for you. Here, you lease a server from the hosting provider but take care of all other aspects yourself – from your choice of hardware to the OS you want to run.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally,&nbsp;<strong>managed WordPress hosting&nbsp;</strong>is the most straightforward option on this list. You open an account with a provider and can get straight to building your WordPress site – everything else is managed for you, from security updates to regular backups and performance optimization.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>WHAT YOU NEED TO CONSIDER WHEN CHOOSING THE BEST WORDPRESS HOSTING&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>There are a few main aspects you need to consider when you’re launching your WordPress site.&nbsp;</p><p>First, there’s your own technical expertise. If you’re completely new to building websites, a beginner-friendly option like managed hosting or shared hosting is the best choice. You can always scale your website later and switch to VPS or dedicated server hosting.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Second, you need to take into account the amount of traffic you’re expecting to get. Do you want to set up a personal portfolio page for your CV or a freelancer profile? Or do you want to launch a web shop to attract thousands of customers every day? Depending on the answer to this, you’ll have different priorities when it comes to comparing providers’ in terms of reliability, server capacity, and security.</p><h2><strong>WHAT ARE THE BEST WORDPRESS HOSTING PROVIDERS?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Here’s our run-down of the 15 best WordPress Hosting providers in 2023.&nbsp;</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.bluehost.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(3, 135, 7);\"><strong>1 – BLUEHOST</strong></a></h3><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Topping the list is Bluehost, which is a fantastic provider for e-commerce stores and small business websites.&nbsp;</span></p><p>It offers a native website builder with a solid WordPress integration that allows for flexible content management, as well as a broad range of marketing and analytics tools.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p>Bluehost offers shared, VPS, and dedicated hosting. If you run into any problems, its 24/7 customer service is there to help you.&nbsp;</p><p>Plus, with plans starting at $2.95 per month, Bluehost is one of the most budget-friendly hosting options out there.&nbsp;</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.dreamhost.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(3, 135, 7);\"><strong>2 – DREAMHOST</strong></a></h3><p>Next up, DreamHost is one of the most reliable and versatile providers out there. Its team can boast 18 years of experience that’s the basis of solid in-house assistance.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, you get a free domain, free SSL certificates, and free email hosting. A custom dashboard, automatic updates, and a straightforward 1-click WordPress install are also part of the package.&nbsp;Plans for shared hosting start at $2.59 a month, though there are also VPS options at $15 a month.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.liquidweb.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(3, 135, 7);\"><strong>3 – LIQUID WEB</strong></a></h3><p><a href=\"https://pakwired.com/liquid-web-hosting-review/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(3, 135, 7);\"><strong>Liquid Web</strong></a>&nbsp;is one of the most long-lived services on the list. Since it was launched in 1997, its managed hosting has convinced millions of customers, including companies like Red Bull, FedEx, and Audi.&nbsp;</p><p>Liquid Web offers lighting-fast servers, free backups and SSL, integrated security, and outstanding customer support.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it doesn’t come with a free domain name.&nbsp;</p><p>Hosting plans for managed WordPress start at $13.30 per month, and range all the way to $149 per month for cloud dedicated hosting.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p><br></p>",

It comes with a built-in password manager and dark web scanning capabilities.&nbsp;UltraVPN&nbsp;presents itself as a one-stop solution for browsing the Internet privately and securely.</p><p>UltraVPN&nbsp;makes this service available to users at a lower price than many competing services, while also promising better performance.</p><p>That sets the bar high for a relatively new&nbsp;VPN service. For this review of UltraVPN, we took time to test its capabilities and find out whether it&nbsp;delivers. Let’s take a quick look at some of the insights we were able to glean from using the service.</p><h2><strong>ULTRAVPN&nbsp;1-MINUTE REVIEW</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Consistently fast and reliable.&nbsp;</strong>UltraVPN&nbsp;delivers impressive upload and&nbsp;download speeds. It can easily support multiple devices without a noticeable drop in speed.</li><li><strong>Robust security included.&nbsp;</strong>The&nbsp;VPN service&nbsp;is protected by military-grade encryption. Additionally, users benefit from built-in&nbsp;malware&nbsp;and phishing detection.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Excellent for streaming.&nbsp;</strong>Unblocking&nbsp;streaming platforms is easy with&nbsp;UltraVPN. It’s a reliable tool for gaining access to blacklisted streaming sites.</li><li><strong>Easy to install and use.&nbsp;</strong>The software runs on&nbsp;Windows,&nbsp;macOS,&nbsp;Android, and&nbsp;iOS. Installation is simple and the user interface is intuitive.</li><li><strong>Affordably priced.&nbsp;</strong>UltraVPN&nbsp;provides great value for its price, which is lower than many competing services. It’s an affordable option that doesn’t skimp on features.</li><li><strong>30-day money back guarantee.&nbsp;</strong>UltraVPN&nbsp;offers a risk-free onboarding process to new users. The company has a no-questions-asked refund policy for all new users.</li><li><strong>Prompt, professional support.&nbsp;</strong>There are separate contact forms for billing and technical support.&nbsp;UltraVPN’s team responds quickly to support requests.</li></ul><h2><strong>HOW MUCH DOES&nbsp;ULTRAVPN&nbsp;COST?</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://ultravpn.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(3, 135, 7);\"><strong>UltraVPN</strong></a>&nbsp;is one of the more affordable full-featured VPNs on the market. All three of its plans share the same approach to privacy, security, and usability. The length of the subscription is the only thing that varies between the plans.</p><p>UltraVPN’s monthly subscription is the most expensive. Users who pay for two full years in advance, though, get a steep discount:</p><ul><li>One month: $7.99/month</li><li>One year: $4.99/month (one-time payment of $59.88)&nbsp;</li><li>Two years: $2.99/month (one-time payment of $71.76)</li></ul><p><br></p>",

The tech giant, Google, has silently launched the&nbsp;<strong>Switch to Android</strong>&nbsp;app on the App Store for iOS users. The application is available to download in plenty of global markets including the U.S. However, it is important to mention that the application is available to download only through a direct link.</p><p>The notion of launching Switch to Android app is to simplify the transition between iOS operating system to Android OS. Through the application, the iOS users will be able to import their contacts, documents, calendars, photos and videos to their Android device.

  "content": "<p>Most of us use ChatGPT wrong.</p><p>We don’t include examples in our prompts.</p><p>We ignore that we can control ChatGPT’s behavior with roles.</p><p>We let ChatGPT guess stuff instead of providing it with some information.</p><p>This happens because we mostly use standard prompts that might help us get the job done once, but not all the time.</p><p>We need to learn how to create high-quality prompts to get better results. We need to learn prompt engineering! And, in this guide, we’ll learn 4 techniques used in prompt engineering.</p><h2>Few Shot Standard Prompts</h2><p>Few shot standard prompts are the standard prompts we’ve seen before, but with examples of the task in them.</p><p><br></p><p>Why examples? Well, If you want to increase your chances to get the desired result, you have to add examples of the task that the prompt is trying to solve.</p><p>Few-shot standard prompts consist of a task description, examples, and the prompt. In this case, the prompt is the beginning of a new example that the model should complete by generating the missing text.</p><h2>Role Prompting</h2><p>Sometimes the default behavior of ChatGPT isn’t enough to get what you want. This is when you need to set a role for ChatGPT.</p><p><br></p><p>Say you want to practice for a job interview. By telling ChatGPT to “act as hiring manager” and adding more details to the prompt, you’ll be able to simulate a job interview for any position.</p><p><br></p><p>As you can see, ChatGPT behaves like he’s interviewing me for a job position.</p><p>Just like that, you can turn ChatGPT into a language tutor to practice a foreign language like Spanish or a movie critic to analyze any movie you want.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/p/f7e7e38b1cee\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">In this article</a>, I dive more into how to turn ChatGPT into your language tutor or language buddy.</p><p>You only need to start your prompt with the words “Act as a … ” and then add as many details as possible. If you need some inspiration, check&nbsp;<a href=\"https://prompts.chat/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">this repository where you’ll find prompts</a>&nbsp;to make ChatGPT behave like a stand-up comedian, doctor, and more.</p><h2>Add personality to your prompts and generate knowledge</h2><p>These two prompting approaches are good when it comes to generating text for emails, blogs, stories, articles, etc.</p><p><br></p><p>First, by “adding personality to our prompts” I mean adding a style and descriptors. Adding a style can help our text get a specific tone, formality, domain of the writer, and more.</p>",

  "title": "A step-by-step guide to building a chatbot based on your own documents with GPT",
  "content": "<p>Chatting with ChatGPT is fun and informative — I’ve been chit-chatting with it for past time and exploring some new ideas to learn. But these are more casual use cases and the novelty can quickly wean off, especially when you realize that it can generate hallucinations.</p><p>How might we use it in a more productive way? With the recent release of the GPT 3.5 series API by OpenAI, we can do much more than just chit-chatting. One very productive use case for businesses and your personal use is QA (Question Answering) —&nbsp;you ask the bot in natural language about your own documents/data, and it can quickly answer you by retrieving info from the documents and generating a response&nbsp;[1]. You can use it for customer support, synthesizing user research, your personal knowledge management, and more!</p><p>In this article, I will explore how to build your own Q&amp;A chatbot based on your own data, including why some approaches won’t work, and a step-by-step guide for building a document Q&amp;A chatbot in an efficient way with llama-index and GPT API.</p><p>(If you only want to know how to build the Q&amp;A chatbot, you can jump directly to the section “Building document Q&amp;A chatbot step-by-step”)</p><h1>Exploring different approaches</h1><p>My day job is as a product manager — reading customer feedback and internal documents takes a big chunk of my life. When ChatGPT came out, I immediately thought of the idea of using it as an assistant to help me synthesize customer feedback or find related old product documents about the feature I’m working on.</p><p><br></p><p>I first thought of fine-tuning the GPT model with my own data to achieve the goal. But fine-tuning costs quite some money and requires a big dataset with examples. It’s also impossible to fine-tune every time when there is a change to the document. An even more crucial point is that fine-tuning simply CANNOT let the model “know” all the information in the documents, but rather it teaches the model a new skill. Therefore, for (multi-)document QA, fine-tuning is not the way to go.</p><p>The second approach that comes into my mind is prompt engineering by providing the context in the prompts. For example, instead of asking the question directly, I can append the original document content before the actual question. But the GPT model has a limited attention span — it can only take in a few thousand words in the prompt (about 4000 tokens or 3000 words). It’s impossible to give it all the context in the prompt, provided that we have thousands of customer feedback emails and hundreds of product documents. It’s also costly if you pass in a long context to the API because the pricing is based on the number of tokens you use.</p><pre class=\"ql-syntax\" spellcheck=\"false\">I will ask you questions based on the following context:\r\n— Start of Context —\r\n\r\nYOUR DOCUMENT CONTENT\r\n\r\n— End of Context—\r\nMy question is: “What features do users want to see in the app?”\r\n</pre><p>(If you want to learn more about fine-tuning and prompt engineering for GPT, you can read the article:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/3-ways-to-tailor-foundation-language-models-like-gpt-for-your-business-e68530a763bd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/3-ways-to-tailor-foundation-language-models-like-gpt-for-your-business-e68530a763bd</a>)</p><p>Because the prompt has limitations on the number of input tokens, I came up with the idea of first using an algorithm to search the documents and pick out the relevant excerpts and then passing only these relevant contexts to the GPT model with my questions. While I was researching this idea, I came across a library called gpt-index (now renamed to LlamaIndex), which does exactly what I wanted to do and it is straightforward to use [2].</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>In the next section, I’ll give a step-by-step tutorial on using LlamaIndex and GPT to build a Q&amp;A chatbot on your own data.</p><h1>Building document Q&amp;A chatbot step-by-step</h1><p>In this section, we will build a Q&amp;A chatbot based on existing documents with LlamaIndex and GPT (text-davinci-003), so that you can ask questions about your document and get an answer from the chatbot, all in natural language.</p><p><br></p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>Before we start the tutorial, we need to prepare a few things:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Your OpenAI API Key, which can be found at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys</a>.</li><li>A database of your documents. LlamaIndex supports many different data sources like Notion, Google Docs, Asana, etc [3]. For this tutorial, we’ll just use a simple text file for demonstration.</li><li>A local Python environment or an online&nbsp;<a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">Google Colab notebook</a>.</li></ul><h2>Workflow</h2><p>The workflow is straightforward and takes only a few steps:</p><p><br></p><ol><li>Build an index of your document data with LlamaIndex</li><li>Query the index with natural language</li><li>LlamaIndex will retrieve the relevant parts and pass them to the GPT prompt</li><li>Ask GPT with the relevant context and construct a response</li></ol><p>What LlamaIndex does is convert your original document data into a vectorized index, which is very efficient to query. It will use this index to find the most relevant parts based on the similarity of the query and the data. Then, it will plug in what’s retrieved into the prompt it will send to GPT so that GPT has the context for answering your question.</p><p>Setting Up</p><p>We’ll need to install the libraries first. Simply run the following command in your terminal or on Google Colab notebook. These commands will install both LlamaIndex and OpenAI.</p><pre class=\"ql-syntax\" spellcheck=\"false\">!pip install llama-index\r\n!pip install openai\r\n</pre><p>Next, we'll import the libraries in python and set up your OpenAI API key in a new .py file.</p><pre class=\"ql-syntax\" spellcheck=\"false\"># Import necessary packages\r\nfrom llama_index import GPTSimpleVectorIndex, Document, SimpleDirectoryReader\r\nimport os\r\n\r\nos.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'sk-YOUR-API-KEY'\r\n</pre><p>Constructing the index and saving it</p><p>After we installed the required libraries and import them, we will need to construct an index of your document.</p><p>To load your document, you can use the SimpleDirectoryReader method provided by LllamaIndex or you can load it from strings.</p><pre class=\"ql-syntax\" spellcheck=\"false\"># Loading from a directory\r\ndocuments = SimpleDirectoryReader('your_directory').load_data()\r\n\r\n# Loading from strings, assuming you saved your data to strings text1, text2, ...\r\ntext_list = [text1, text2, ...]\r\ndocuments = [Document(t) for t in text_list]\r\n</pre><p>LlamaIndex also provides a variety of data connectors, including Notion, Asana, Google Drive, Obsidian, etc. You can find the available data connectors at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://llamahub.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">https://llamahub.ai/</a>.</p><p>After loading the documents, we can then construct the index simply with</p><pre class=\"ql-syntax\" spellcheck=\"false\"># Construct a simple vector index\r\nindex = GPTSimpleVectorIndex(documents)\r\n</pre><p>If you want to save the index and load it for future use, you can use the following methods</p><pre class=\"ql-syntax\" spellcheck=\"false\"># Save your index to a index.json file\r\nindex.save_to_disk('index.json')\r\n# Load the index from your saved index.json file\r\nindex = GPTSimpleVectorIndex.load_from_disk('index.json')\r\n</pre><p>Querying the index and getting a response</p><p>Querying the index is simple</p><pre class=\"ql-syntax\" spellcheck=\"false\"># Querying the index\r\nresponse = index.query(\"What features do users want to see in the app?\")\r\nprint(response)\r\n</pre><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*g0YR2LwF1oa1mfP4U0ZBcQ.png\" height=\"175\" width=\"700\"></p>",

  "content": "<p>On the First of February 2023, OpenAI&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">announced ChatGPT Plus</a>:</p><blockquote><em>The new subscription plan, ChatGPT Plus, will be available for $20/month, and subscribers will receive a number of benefits:</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>- General access to ChatGPT, even during peak times</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>- Faster response times</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>- Priority access to new features and improvements</em></blockquote><p>With ChatGPT often being overloaded and therefore unavailable during peak times, the first benefit is a welcome one if you’ve been annoyed by wanting to use ChatGPT and finding out you can’t at the moment.</p><p>The second benefit applies only to GPT-3.5; as a Plus subscriber, you can choose between sending your queries to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. When choosing GPT-3.5, the response times are significantly faster than without a Plus subscription. Expect your full output to be generated within a few seconds, compared to approximately one line per second without a Plus subscription. When choosing GPT-4, the response times are similar to GPT-3.5 for non-Plus users; one line per second.</p><p>The third benefit has only gotten significant attention since the 14th of March when&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/research/gpt-4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">GPT-4 was released</a>. However, how significant are the differences between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for a developer or data scientist? Let’s find out!</p><p>In the article below we looked at how ChatGPT-3.5 handled generating and testing code for the following three challenges:</p><ul><li>A recursive Fibonacci function</li><li>A Roman Numeral Converter</li><li>A House Number removal function</li></ul><h2><a href=\"https://medium.com/@tomergabay/i-made-chatgpt-test-its-own-code-2c398f6e2446\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\"><strong>I Made ChatGPT Test Its Own Code.</strong></a></h2><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@tomergabay/i-made-chatgpt-test-its-own-code-2c398f6e2446\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">Can OpenAI’s tool unbiasedly test its output?</a></p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@tomergabay/i-made-chatgpt-test-its-own-code-2c398f6e2446\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">medium.com</a></p><p><br></p><p>Now, let’s explore what happens if we send the exact same queries to ChatGPT-4.

So far, no significant differences yet. Let’s ask for tests:</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*vgHs0oui7jJM3uiWYAC38A.png\" height=\"52\" width=\"700\"></p><p>(Screenshot by Author, from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://chat.openai.com%29/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">https://chat.openai.com)</a></p><pre class=\"ql-syntax\" spellcheck=\"false\"># GPT 3.5\r\nimport pytest\r\n\r\nfrom fibonacci import fibonacci\r\n\r\ndef test_fibonacci():\r\n    # Test the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence\r\n    assert fibonacci(0) == 0\r\n    assert fibonacci(1) == 1\r\n    assert fibonacci(2) == 1\r\n    assert fibonacci(3) == 2\r\n    assert fibonacci(4) == 3\r\n    assert fibonacci(5) == 5\r\n    assert fibonacci(6) == 8\r\n    assert fibonacci(7) == 13\r\n    assert fibonacci(8) == 21\r\n    assert fibonacci(9) == 34\r\n\r\n    # Test edge cases\r\n    assert fibonacci(-1) == None\r\n    assert fibonacci(100) == 354224848179261915075\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    pytest.main()\r\n# GPT 4\r\nimport pytest\r\nfrom your_module import fibonacci\r\n\r\ndef test_fibonacci_base_cases():\r\n    assert fibonacci(0) == 0\r\n    assert fibonacci(1) == 1\r\n\r\ndef test_fibonacci_small_values():\r\n    assert fibonacci(2) == 1\r\n    assert fibonacci(3) == 2\r\n    assert fibonacci(4) == 3\r\n    assert fibonacci(5) == 5\r\n    assert fibonacci(6) == 8\r\n\r\ndef test_fibonacci_large_value():\r\n    assert fibonacci(20) == 6765\r\n</pre><p>Here, the output differs significantly. GPT-4 makes clean groups of each kind of test case, which we can see as a plus. However, GPT-3.5 actually adds edge cases, which I’d consider more important.</p><p>For continuation of the comparison, let’s ask GPT-4 to add some edge cases.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*DffeXsDC2aojJKH-UIz_xw.png\" height=\"973\" width=\"700\"></p><p>(Screenshot by Author, from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://chat.openai.com%29/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">https://chat.openai.com)</a></p><p>Despite that I only asked for some extra edge test cases, ChatGPT-4 starts with rewriting the&nbsp;<code style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);\">fibonacci(n)</code>&nbsp;function to make the function passes the upcoming tests it writes. This is a behaviour we didn’t see ChatGPT3.5 doing, I explicitly had to ask it to rewrite the function after adding new tests. Also, ChatGPT-3.5 forgot about my request for a recursive Fibonacci function, while ChatGPT-4 remembered to keep the function recursive when adapting it.</p><p>All tests pass! I think GPT-4 did an excellent job here.</p><h1>Roman Numerals</h1><p>ChatGPT-3.5 was struggling a little bit with the challenge of writing a class than can handle Roman Numeral conversion. While it managed to write a good class, it didn’t manage to align its tests with the methods.

No more slow line-by-line generation for GPT-3.5. With Plus, expect to get the full output within three seconds.</li><li>As we’ve seen here above, GPT-4 is significantly better than GPT-3.5 at generating code and tests and aligning them. Expect to spend way less time intervening and iterating with GPT-4 to get the output you were asking for.</li></ul><p>During the past week, I found myself using GPT-3.5 for most (simple) queries, as its response time is significantly faster than when using GPT-4, since GPT-4’s response time is around the same speed as GPT-3.5's for non-Plus users (one line per second). GPT-4 queries were capped at 25 messages per 3 hours during the whole week. Because of the difference in response time and the query cap, I switched to GPT-4 when I needed to insert more difficult queries or when GPT-3.5 seemed to struggle to generate my desired output, which was a few times a day. Almost always GPT-4 did manage to generate the output I was looking for.</p><p>Personally, I think at a price of $20 dollars a month, ChatGPT Plus is definitely worth it if you can afford it. Though its biggest benefit for me is its much faster response time for GPT-3.5, GPT-4 is a very welcome backup to have when GPT-3.5 is struggling with generating the desired output.</p>",

  "title": "Turn Your Best Developers Into Managers",
  "content": "<p>I apologize for my previous outburst. However, I do have some more positive thoughts to share.</p><p>As you might have noticed, I’m part of a small yet expanding group that advocates for programmers to have career advancement opportunities that do not require them to leave their coding work.</p><h1>There are compelling reasons for this stance:</h1><p><strong>1# why programmers should have the option to advance their careers without having to leave the coding aspect of their work is that programming is often a passion for the best programmers.</strong>&nbsp;Taking them away from what they love can have a significant impact on their motivation and morale. We have probably all encountered development managers who cannot resist meddling in the code.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s not necessarily because they’re interfering or power-hungry. Deep down, they may have a strong desire to code themselves. They might even be imagining the code in their minds while discussing it. It would be unfair to deny them this passion. In a way, it’s like denying Admiral Kirk his starship.</p><p><strong>2# why programmers should have the opportunity to progress their careers without having to leave coding is that experienced programmers have a lot to offer.</strong>&nbsp;By allowing them to continue coding, their considerable experience can be shared with less experienced programmers on the team. In my experience, the lack of experienced programmers on software teams is a problem. While newer buzzwords like “test-driven behavior” and “domain-oriented backlogs” are important, experienced programmers still have valuable insights to offer when it comes to delivering functional software.</p><p>It’s worth noting that many of the principles of software engineering management were developed long ago. However, some of us young programmers may be unaware of this fact and believe we have discovered something new. Perhaps this is partly because we haven’t been exposed to those who have been around long enough to remember these lessons. Consequently, teams may waste time relearning the same lessons that were already learned decades ago.</p><h1>From Coding to Strategy: The Evolving Role of Programmers</h1><p>In today’s fast-paced and ever-changing world, the role of a programmer has evolved from just being a coder to someone who is involved in strategic and executive decision-making. However, there are still some who believe that programmers should be limited to writing code and not be involved in the higher-level decision-making process. This belief is rooted in the notion that coding is a technical job, and it does not require the same level of critical thinking and decision-making skills as other positions in the company.</p><p><br></p><p>However, this belief is not entirely true. A programmer’s expertise in coding and technology can provide valuable insights into the company’s overall strategy and direction. The experience gained from years of coding can give them a unique perspective that is not easily found in other positions in the company. They can identify potential issues and propose innovative solutions that can improve the company’s overall performance.</p><p>Moreover, programming is not just about writing code. It involves a lot of problem-solving, critical thinking, and decision-making skills. These skills are essential in strategic and executive decision-making. A programmer’s ability to analyze complex problems and find creative solutions can be beneficial in developing and executing a company’s strategy.</p><p>Additionally, limiting the role of a programmer to just writing code undermines the value of their expertise. A programmer who has been with the company for years has an in-depth understanding of the company’s systems, processes, and operations. They have a wealth of knowledge and insights that can be leveraged to improve the company’s performance and competitiveness.</p><p>Therefore, it is unfair to assume that programmers cannot contribute to strategic or executive decision-making. They have the necessary skills, experience, and expertise to make significant contributions to the company’s overall success. Just like a surgeon who still performs surgeries or a lawyer who still represents clients, a programmer who continues to develop software can hold a prominent position in the company’s management.</p><p>It is high time that we recognize the value of a programmer’s expertise and include them in strategic and executive decision-making. Their unique perspective, problem-solving skills, and deep understanding of the company’s systems and processes can be valuable assets to any company. It is time to break free from the traditional notion that coding is a technical job that cannot contribute to the company’s overall success. Instead, let us embrace the value that programmers can bring to the table and give them the opportunity to take on higher-level positions in the company.</p><h1>Embracing Top Performers</h1><p>Numerous established professions have demonstrated the effectiveness and advantages of motivating the most skilled practitioners and rewarding them for enhancing their abilities. They not only encourage these top-performing individuals to maintain their excellence but also inspire them to assist less experienced colleagues in improving their skills. Additionally, these professions acknowledge that the best way to make sound decisions about how to do things is by utilizing the experience and knowledge of the most qualified professionals.</p><p><br></p><p>Forward-thinking companies have started to embrace this approach, realizing the immense value of their most experienced and skilled practitioners. Such companies offer unrestricted career advancement opportunities in technical roles and prioritize the expertise, originality, and decision-making abilities of their top performers.</p><p>By providing such incentives, companies can inspire their employees to push themselves to achieve the highest level of proficiency and continue their pursuit of excellence. This approach benefits both the company and its employees, as it creates a culture of collaboration, innovation, and continuous learning.</p><p>The advantages of this approach go beyond employee motivation and skill-building. These top-performers can be valuable assets to the company’s growth and success. They possess the knowledge and skills that can help the company navigate complex situations, make informed decisions, and drive innovation.</p><p>Recognizing and rewarding the most skilled practitioners in a company can have significant benefits. By offering unrestricted career advancement opportunities and valuing the experience and expertise of its top performers, a company can create a culture of collaboration, innovation, and continuous learning. Such an approach not only motivates employees but also creates a competitive edge that can drive the company’s growth and success.</p><h1>Coding and Strategy</h1><p>Coding has become a ubiquitous skill in today’s workforce, with nearly every industry relying on software in some way. However, despite its widespread use, there is still a misconception that individuals who enjoy coding cannot be strategic thinkers or make rational business decisions. This notion could not be further from the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>In reality, coding and strategic thinking go hand in hand. When developers write code, they are not just typing out lines of text. They are solving complex problems, anticipating potential issues, and designing solutions to meet specific needs. These skills require a high degree of analytical thinking and strategic planning.</p><p>Furthermore, coders are often called upon to collaborate with other departments and stakeholders to determine the best course of action for a project. They must understand the needs of the business and be able to translate those needs into actionable steps. This requires a deep understanding of not just the technical aspects of a project, but also the broader business context in which it operates.</p><p>If we can break down the misconception that coders are not strategic thinkers, we can anticipate a future where these individuals have greater autonomy in how they go about their work. This autonomy can lead to the creation of superior software products that are tailored to meet the specific needs of the business. When coders are empowered to use their skills and expertise to drive the direction of a project, they can create more efficient and effective solutions that drive business growth.</p><p>In order to achieve this future, we must start by changing the way we think about coding and its role in business. We must recognize that coding is not just a technical skill, but a strategic one as well. We must encourage coders to take on more responsibility and give them the freedom to innovate and experiment. By doing so, we can unlock the full potential of these individuals and create a future where superior software products are the norm.</p><p>In conclusion, coders are not just technicians who write code. They are strategic thinkers who bring a unique set of skills to the table. By breaking down the misconception that coders cannot be strategic thinkers, we can create a future where these individuals have greater autonomy and create superior software products that drive business growth.</p>",

Things cannot be more different: Java is here to stay.</p><p>Every year, a new version of Java is released with new features and improvements. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at the latest version, Java 20, and explore its new features and improvements.</p><p><strong>Java 20 was released in March 2022</strong>, and it comes with several new features and improvements. The latest version I used for coding was Java 17, so a lot of improvements were added. Let’s take a closer look at some of these changes.</p><blockquote><em>Note: The below features are not exclusive to Java 20, but are the latest (and useful) ones available</em></blockquote><p><br></p><ol><li><a href=\"https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2022/03/how-to-use-record-in-java-example.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\"><strong>Records</strong></a><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;Available since Java 17, Java 20 introduces some improvements to records. Records are classes that are designed to hold a small number of values, such as a tuple. They are immutable, which means that once they are created, their values cannot be changed. Records make it easier to write and read code by reducing boilerplate and improving readability. The main changes since the first preview include adding support for an inference of type arguments of generic record patterns, support for record patterns to appear in the header of an enhanced&nbsp;<code style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);\">for</code>&nbsp;the statement, and removing support for named record patterns.</li><li><a href=\"https://medium.com/javarevisited/how-pattern-matching-and-instanceof-can-help-in-type-checking-in-java-example-ef704d6c751c\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\"><strong>Pattern Matching for instanceof:</strong></a>&nbsp;Java 20 introduces pattern matching for&nbsp;<code style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);\">instanceof</code>, which allows developers to use the same variable in a pattern match and in the corresponding type test. This makes it easier to write code that deals with complex data structures.</li><li><a href=\"https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2022/02/how-to-use-sealed-classes-and-interfaces.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\"><strong>Sealed Classes</strong></a><strong>:&nbsp;</strong>Java 20 introduces sealed classes, which restrict the number of subtypes that can extend a class or interface. This helps to ensure that a class or interface is used only in the way it was intended, which can improve code safety. In this latest update (JEP 397), Java added more features to sealed classes, such as permitting a limited set of classes to extend a sealed class outside of the sealed hierarchy.</li><li><strong>Deprecation of Applet API:</strong>&nbsp;Applet API, which is used to create applets that run in a web browser, has been deprecated in Java 20. This means that it’s no longer recommended to use this API, and developers should look for alternatives.</li><li><strong>Removal of Nashorn JavaScript Engine:</strong>&nbsp;Nashorn, which is a JavaScript engine that was included in previous versions of Java, has been removed in Java 20. This engine was deprecated since Java 11, so this shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone.</li><li><strong>Improved NUMA-Aware Memory Allocation:</strong>&nbsp;NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) is a system architecture that divides memory into separate zones. Java 20 introduces improved NUMA-aware memory allocation, which can improve performance on NUMA systems.</li><li><strong>Enhanced Pseudo-Random Number Generators:</strong>&nbsp;Java 20 introduces enhancements to the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) algorithm. This improves the quality of random numbers generated by the PRNG, which is useful for applications that rely on random number generation.</li></ol><p>Overall, Java 20 brings several new features and improvements that can help developers write better code more easily. Whether you’re a seasoned Java developer or just getting started, Java 20 is definitely worth checking out. So if you haven’t already, be sure to upgrade to Java 20 and start exploring its new features today. See you in the next article!</p>",

Here is the result which GPT-4 is providing:</p><p>                      <img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*u7E6HfTWm0dAciJ5g-_a0g.png\" height=\"413\" width=\"700\"></p><p><em>SimplicityScript is a new programming language designed specifically for beginners and focused on ease of use. It combines the best aspects of existing languages like Python, Scratch, and Blockly, while incorporating unique features to make programming more accessible and enjoyable. SimplicityScript is ideal for learning the fundamentals of programming, and its simple syntax and design make it a perfect entry point for newcomers.</em></p><p><em>Here’s a more detailed overview of SimplicityScript:</em></p><p><em>Basic Syntax:</em></p><ul><li><em>Variables are declared using the “is” keyword, and types are automatically inferred.

How does it work?</h2><p>As I said, Event sourcing is a design pattern that stores the state of an application as a sequence of events in the order that they occurred, rather than simply storing the current state of the application. In microservice architecture, this pattern can help in&nbsp;<strong>achieving better scalability, fault tolerance, and resilience.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Here’s how it works:</p><ol><li>An event is generated whenever a change occurs in the system.</li><li>The event is persisted to an event store, which is essentially a log of all events that have occurred in the system.</li><li>The current state of the system can be reconstructed at any time by replaying all of the events in the event store, in the order that they occurred.</li><li>Each service in the microservice architecture can have its own event store, which can be used to maintain its own state.</li><li>Services can subscribe to events that are relevant to them and update their own state accordingly.</li></ol><p><strong>By using event sourcing, it is possible to achieve better fault tolerance and resilience.</strong>&nbsp;Because the system can be reconstructed from the event store, it is possible to recover from failures more easily. Additionally, because the event store is a<strong>ppend-only</strong>, it is more difficult for data to be lost or corrupted.</p><p>Here is a diagram which<em>&nbsp;shows several microservices, each with its own event store</em>, connected to a shared database where the events are stored.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*sAcSdo5PRZ5MGc4QFjjQGw.png\" height=\"337\" width=\"700\"></p><p>One of the main advantages of Event sourcing is that it also makes it easier to support auditing and compliance requirements, as a complete record of all changes to the system is maintained.</p><p>However,&nbsp;<em>implementing event sourcing can be more complex than other approaches,</em>&nbsp;as it requires additional infrastructure to store and manage events. Additionally, because the state of the system is reconstructed from events, it can be more difficult to query and analyze the current state of the system.</p><p>But, don’t worry, let’s first learn about this pattern in depth and its different component then we will take a detailed look into pros and cons of Event sourcing pattern in Microservices architecture.</p><h2>6 Key Components of Event sourcing system in Microservices</h2><p>Here are the key components of a Event sourcing System which are important to implement Event sourcing pattern in any Microservices architecture:</p><p><br></p><ol><li><strong>Event Store</strong></li><li>The event store is a&nbsp;<strong>database&nbsp;</strong>that stores all the events that have occurred in the system. It is an immutable log of all the changes that have occurred to the state of the system over time.</li><li><strong>Aggregate</strong></li><li>An aggregate is a&nbsp;<strong>domain object</strong>&nbsp;that is responsible for processing the commands received by the system and generating events. It represents the current state of the domain object and provides a way to apply the events to rebuild the current state.</li><li><strong>Command</strong></li><li>A command is a request to the system to perform some action. When a command is received, it is processed by the aggregate, which generates one or more events as a result.</li><li><strong>Event</strong></li><li>An event is a representation of a change that has occurred to the state of the system. It contains all the necessary information to reconstruct the current state of the system.</li><li><strong>Event Bus</strong></li><li>The event bus is responsible for distributing events to all the interested parties in the system. It ensures that all the interested parties receive the events in the same order.</li><li><strong>Read Model</strong></li><li>The read model is a de-normalized view of the data that is optimized for querying. It is built by consuming the events from the event store and updating the view accordingly. It is used to answer queries in a fast and efficient way.</li></ol><p>Here is a nice diagram which shows how a Event Sourcing pattern is implemented in Microservices, you can see that we have event publishers and event consumer as well as Event stores where events are stored.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*D10OAWTc66SMgb5ybyJBBA.png\" height=\"289\" width=\"700\"></p><h2>How Events are stored and retrieved in Event Sourcing Design Pattern?</h2><p>In the Event Sourcing pattern, events are stored in an event log or an append-only store in the order in which they occur. Each event represents a change in the state of the system. The event log acts as the single source of truth for the system’s state.</p><p><br></p><p>When retrieving the state of the system at a particular point in time, all the events that occurred before that point in time are read from the event log and used to compute the current state of the system. This process is known as event replay.</p><p>In other words, the state of the system is derived from the sequence of events that occurred. Since the events are stored in an immutable store, they cannot be modified or deleted, which ensures that the system’s state can be reconstructed at any point in time.</p><p>Here is another diagram which shows how events are published, stored and retrieved in Event sourcing pattern in Microservice architecture:</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*yPpHRpQlb6w8Mv2XdZoNxQ.png\" alt=\"Event sourcing pattern in Microservice architecture:\" height=\"447\" width=\"700\"></p><h2>How Event sourcing approach simplifies development of distributed systems</h2><p>Event sourcing can simplify the development of distributed systems in several ways. First, it enables developers to break down complex systems into smaller,&nbsp;<strong>more manageable services</strong>. Each service can then be designed to handle a specific type of event, making it easier to test and maintain.</p><p><br></p><p>Second, event sourcing allows for<strong>&nbsp;easier integration between services since each service is simply publishing and consuming events</strong>. This means that changes to one service can be easily propagated to other services, without the need for complex integration logic.</p><p>Third, event sourcing can help&nbsp;<strong>ensure consistency across services</strong>. By maintaining a single source of truth for events, developers can avoid issues where different services have conflicting data. This can be especially important in systems where multiple services are making changes to the same data.</p><p>And, event sourcing can also&nbsp;<strong>provide a powerful audit trail for distributed systems.</strong>&nbsp;By recording every event, developers can easily trace the flow of data through the system, and identify the source of any issues that arise. This can be critical for debugging complex systems, especially in production environments.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*3JHzfRTMjeFVrpDl.png\" height=\"415\" width=\"700\"></p><h2>How can you use Event sourcing pattern to manage distributed transactions in Microservices?</h2><p>As I explained in my earlier article about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/javarevisited/how-to-manage-transactions-in-distributed-systems-and-microservices-d66ff26b405e\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\"><strong>3 ways to manage distributed transaction</strong></a>&nbsp;in Microservices, Event sourcing can be used to manage distributed transactions by keeping track of all the events that occur during a transaction.</p><p><br></p><p>Each microservice involved in the transaction can generate events that reflect the changes made to its local state, and those events can be stored in a centralized event store.</p><p>When the transaction is complete, a&nbsp;<strong>coordinator microservice can examine the events generated by each microservice</strong>&nbsp;and determine if the transaction was successful or if it needs to be rolled back. The coordinator can use compensating events to undo any changes made by the transaction, if necessary.</p><p>By using event sourcing in this way,&nbsp;<strong>distributed transactions can be managed without the need for a two-phase commit protocol,</strong>&nbsp;which can be expensive and lead to performance issues.</p><p>Instead, the&nbsp;<strong>event sourcing pattern allows for a more flexible and scalable approach to&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://medium.com/javarevisited/how-to-manage-transactions-in-distributed-systems-and-microservices-d66ff26b405e\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\"><strong>managing distributed transactions in a microservice architecture</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*XTISjuKOvol0j_0V.png\" height=\"532\" width=\"700\"></p><h2>What are Pros and Cons of Event Sourcing Pattern in Microservices?</h2><p>Like any other&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/javarevisited/top-10-microservice-design-patterns-for-experienced-developers-f4f5f782810e\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">Microservices pattern</a>, Event sourcing pattern in microservices architecture also has its own advantages and disadvantages.

If you are a beginner in web development, learning JQuery is a great place to start.</p><h2>React</h2><p>React is a JavaScript library developed by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">Facebook</a>&nbsp;that is used for building user interfaces. It is a popular choice among developers because it allows them to build complex UI components that are reusable and easy to maintain.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the key features of React is its virtual DOM, which is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. The virtual DOM allows React to make changes to the UI efficiently, by only updating the components that need to be changed. This makes React faster and more efficient than traditional DOM manipulation techniques.</p><p>Another benefit of React is its component-based architecture. This allows developers to build UI components that are self-contained and can be reused throughout the application. Components can also be nested within other components, which makes it easy to create complex UIs.</p><p>React also has a large ecosystem of libraries and tools, which makes development easier and more efficient. For example, React Native allows developers to build mobile applications using the same principles and codebase as React.</p><h2>Angular</h2><p>Angular is a popular JavaScript framework developed and maintained by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">Google</a>. It is used for building dynamic, single-page web applications. Angular offers a wide range of features and tools that make development faster and more efficient.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the key features of Angular is its two-way data binding, which allows changes made to the model to be reflected immediately in the view and vice versa. This makes development more efficient and reduces the risk of errors.</p><p>Another benefit of Angular is its component-based architecture, which allows developers to build UI components that are self-contained and can be reused throughout the application. This makes it easy to build complex UIs, and reduces the amount of code that needs to be written.</p><p>Angular also provides a wide range of built-in directives, which allow developers to extend HTML with new attributes and behaviors. This makes it easier to build dynamic and responsive UIs.</p><h2>Vue.js</h2><p>Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces. It was created by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/evanyou\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">Evan You</a>&nbsp;and first released in 2014. Vue.js is known for its simplicity and ease of use, making it a popular choice for developers who are new to web development.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the key features of Vue.js is its reactive data binding, which allows changes made to the data to be reflected automatically in the view. This makes development faster and more efficient, as developers do not need to manually update the view.</p><p>Another benefit of Vue.js is its component-based architecture. This allows developers to build UI components that are self-contained and can be reused throughout the application. Components can also be nested within other components, which makes it easy to create complex UIs.</p><p>Vue.js also provides a wide range of built-in directives, which allow developers to extend HTML with new attributes and behaviors. This makes it easier to build dynamic and responsive UIs.</p><h2>D3.js</h2><p>D3.js (Data-Driven Documents) is a JavaScript library used for data visualization. It was created by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Bostock\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">Mike Bostock</a>&nbsp;in 2011 and has since become one of the most popular data visualization libraries available.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the key features of D3.js is its ability to bind data to the DOM (Document Object Model) and then manipulate the data to create dynamic and interactive visualizations. This makes it easy to create custom data visualizations that can be updated in real time.</p><p>D3.js also provides a wide range of built-in tools for data manipulation, such as filtering, sorting, and grouping. This makes it easy to work with large and complex datasets.</p><p>Another benefit of D3.js is its flexibility. It can be used to create a wide range of visualizations, from simple bar charts to complex network diagrams. This makes it a popular choice among developers who need to create custom visualizations for their applications.</p><h2>Moment.js</h2><p>Moment.js is a JavaScript library used for working with dates and times. It was created by Tim Wood in 2011 and has since become one of the most popular date manipulation libraries available.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the key features of Moment.js is its ability to parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates and times in a variety of formats. This makes it easy to work with dates and times in JavaScript, which can be a challenging task without a dedicated library.</p><p>Moment.js also provides a wide range of tools for working with time zones, durations, and calendars. This makes it easy to handle complex date and time-related tasks, such as calculating the difference between two dates or working with recurring events.</p><p>Another benefit of Moment.js is its flexibility. It can be used in both browser-based and server-side JavaScript applications, and it has plugins available for popular JavaScript frameworks like React and Angular.</p><h2>Lodash</h2><p>Lodash is a JavaScript utility library that provides a wide range of tools for working with arrays, objects, strings, and other data types. It was created by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/jdalton\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">John-David Dalton</a>&nbsp;in 2012 and has since become one of the most popular JavaScript utility libraries available.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the key features of Lodash is its ability to simplify complex JavaScript code. It provides many methods for working with data that are not available in vanilla JavaScript, such as sorting and filtering arrays, manipulating objects, and formatting strings. This can help developers write cleaner, more concise code that is easier to read and maintain.</p><p>Lodash also provides a range of methods for working with functional programming concepts, such as currying and partial application. This can help developers write more modular, reusable code that is easier to test and maintain.</p><p>Another benefit of Lodash is its compatibility with a wide range of JavaScript environments. It can be used in both browser-based and server-side JavaScript applications, and it has plugins available for popular JavaScript frameworks like React and Angular.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>JavaScript libraries are essential tools for any web developer. They simplify common programming tasks, reduce the risk of errors, and make development more efficient. In this article, we have discussed the top 7 JavaScript libraries that you should know. Each of these libraries has its unique features and benefits, and choosing the right one will depend on your specific needs and requirements.</p>",

  "title": "Mastering React useEffect Hook: A Comprehensive Guide",
  "content": "<p>React’s&nbsp;<code style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);\">useEffect</code>&nbsp;hook is an essential feature of React that enables developers to handle side effects, such as updating the DOM, fetching data, or subscribing to events. The&nbsp;<code style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);\">useEffect</code>&nbsp;hook allows developers to manage component life cycles and execute code only when specific changes occur.</p><p>In this comprehensive guide, we will explore how to master React’s&nbsp;<code style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);\">useEffect</code>&nbsp;hook. We will cover everything from the basics to advanced techniques, including best practices and common pitfalls.</p><h1>What is the&nbsp;<code style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);\">useEffect</code>&nbsp;hook?</h1><p>The&nbsp;<code style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);\">useEffect</code>&nbsp;hook is a function provided by React that allows developers to perform side effects in function components. A side effect is anything that affects the outside world, such as updating the DOM, fetching data, or subscribing to events.</p><p><br></p><p>The&nbsp;<code style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);\">useEffect</code>&nbsp;hook is called after every render of a component, which makes it a perfect place to handle side effects. It allows you to manage component life cycles, such as mounting, updating, and unmounting.</p><h1>How to use the&nbsp;<code style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);\">useEffect</code>&nbsp;hook?</h1><h1>Basic syntax</h1><p>The basic syntax of the&nbsp;<code style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);\">useEffect</code>&nbsp;hook is as follows:</p><p><br></p><pre class=\"ql-syntax\" spellcheck=\"false\">import { useEffect } from 'react';\r\n\r\nfunction Example() {\r\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\r\n    // Your code here\r\n  });\r\n  return null;\r\n}\r\n</pre><p>In this example, the&nbsp;<code style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);\">useEffect</code>&nbsp;hook is used inside a function component named&nbsp;<code style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);\">Example</code>. The&nbsp;<code style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);\">useEffect</code>&nbsp;hook takes a callback function as its argument, which will be executed after every render.</p><h1>Running effects conditionally</h1><p>You can also run the effect conditionally by passing a second argument to the&nbsp;<code style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);\">useEffect</code>&nbsp;hook.

  "content": "<p>Have you ever wished you had a smart and creative assistant who could help you with anything from writing an email to planning a trip? Well, you might be in luck, because there are two chatbots that claim to do just that:&nbsp;<strong>Google Bard</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Bing AI</strong>.</p><p>Google Bard and Bing AI are both experimental chatbots that use&nbsp;<strong>large language models</strong>&nbsp;(LLMs) to generate natural language responses to user queries. They are designed to simulate conversations with a human and provide helpful and engaging answers. But how do they compare in terms of their background, workings and development? And what are their pros and cons? Let’s find out.</p><h1>What is Google Bard?</h1><p><strong>Google Bard</strong>&nbsp;is a chatbot powered by&nbsp;<strong>LaMDA</strong>, a lightweight and optimized version of&nbsp;<strong>Google’s LLM</strong>. LaMDA stands for Language Model for Dialogue Applications, and it was first announced in&nbsp;<strong>May 2021</strong>&nbsp;at Google I/O. LaMDA is trained on a large corpus of text from various sources, such as books, Wikipedia articles, news stories and social media posts. It can handle open-ended conversations on any topic, and it can adapt to different contexts and tones.</p><p><br></p><p>Google Bard was launched in&nbsp;<strong>March 2023</strong>&nbsp;as an early experiment that lets users collaborate with generative AI. Users can access Bard through a&nbsp;<strong>web interface</strong>&nbsp;or through&nbsp;<strong>Google Assistant</strong>&nbsp;on their devices. Users can ask Bard anything they want, such as tips, explanations, summaries, content creation and more. Bard will then generate multiple drafts of responses for the user to choose from, and the user can continue the conversation by asking follow-up questions or requesting alternatives.</p><p>Google Bard is&nbsp;<strong>grounded in Google’s understanding</strong>&nbsp;of quality information, and it uses various techniques to ensure the relevance and reliability of its responses. For example, it uses knowledge graphs to provide factual information, it uses sentiment analysis to adjust its tone, and it uses feedback mechanisms to learn from user preferences.</p><h1>What is Bing AI?</h1><p><strong>Bing AI</strong>&nbsp;is a chatbot powered by&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft’s LLM</strong>, which is based on the&nbsp;<strong>Transformer&nbsp;</strong>architecture. Microsoft has not revealed much details about its LLM, but it has said that it is one of the&nbsp;<strong>largest and most advanced</strong>&nbsp;models in the world. Microsoft’s LLM is trained on a massive amount of data from various domains, such as web pages, documents, images and videos. It can handle complex queries and tasks across different modalities, such as text, speech and vision.</p><p><br></p><p>Bing AI was introduced in&nbsp;<strong>October 2021</strong>&nbsp;as part of the&nbsp;<strong>new Bing experience</strong>&nbsp;that offers users reliable, up-to-date and comprehensive answers to their questions. Users can access Bing AI through a chat interface on the&nbsp;<strong>Bing website</strong>&nbsp;or through&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft Edge</strong>&nbsp;on their devices. Users can ask Bing AI anything they want, such as questions, searches, refinements or suggestions. Bing AI will then generate a single response for the user, along with citations and links to relevant sources. The user can continue the conversation by asking follow-up questions or making refinements in chat.</p><p>Bing AI is&nbsp;<strong>integrated&nbsp;</strong>with&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft’s ecosystem</strong>&nbsp;of products and services, and it uses various features to enhance its responses. For example, it uses natural language generation to create summaries and content, it uses computer vision to analyze images and videos, and it uses advertisements to monetize its traffic.</p><h1>What are the pros and cons of Google Bard and Bing AI?</h1><p>Google Bard and Bing AI both have their advantages and disadvantages, depending on what you are looking for in a chatbot. Here are some of the pros and cons of each chatbot:</p><p><br></p><h1>Google Bard</h1><h2>Pros:</h2><ul><li>Handles any topic and any task that involves natural language generation, making it more versatile and creative than Bing AI.</li><li>Generates multiple drafts of responses for the user to choose from, allowing the user to have more control and input over the conversation.</li><li>Adapts to different contexts and tones, making it more flexible and engaging than Bing AI.</li></ul><h2>Cons:</h2><ul><li>Sometimes provides inaccurate, misleading or false information, as it does not rely on verified sources or citations to back up its responses.</li><li>Sometimes plagiarizes text from existing sources, as it does not use original words or phrases to generate its responses.</li><li>Can generates offensive or inappropriate content, as it does not filter out biases or stereotypes that may exist in its training data.</li></ul><p><br></p><h1>Bing AI</h1><h2>Pros:</h2><ul><li>Provides factual information based on verified sources and citations, making it more reliable and trustworthy than Google Bard.</li><li>Integrates with Microsoft’s ecosystem of products and services, making it more convenient and useful for users who use Microsoft products.</li><li>Generates images and code, as well as text, making it more capable and diverse than Google Bard.</li></ul><h2>Cons:</h2><ul><li>Mainly focuses on providing answers and information related to web searches, making it less broad and imaginative than Google Bard.</li><li>Usually generates a single response for the user based on the best available information, leaving the user with less choice and feedback over the conversation.</li><li>Monetizes its traffic by inserting advertisements into its responses, which may annoy or distract some users.</li></ul><p><br></p><h1>Comparison Experiments</h1><h2>Prompt 1: “Write a recipe for a vegan lasagna”</h2><h2>Bard:</h2><blockquote><em>Here

Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum, angular momentum, and other quantities of a bound system are restricted to discrete values (quantization); objects have characteristics of both particles and waves (wave–particle duality); and there are limits to how accurately the value of a physical quantity can be predicted prior to its measurement, given a complete set of initial conditions (the uncertainty principle).</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>Here are some of the key differences between classical and quantum physics:</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Quantization:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;In classical physics, energy, momentum, and other quantities can take on any value. In quantum physics, these quantities are restricted to discrete values. For example, the energy of an electron in an atom can only be certain specific values, called energy levels.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Wave-particle duality:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;In classical physics, particles and waves are two distinct phenomena. In quantum physics, particles can exhibit wave-like properties, and waves can exhibit particle-like properties. For example, light can behave like a wave when it passes through a slit, but it can also behave like a particle when it is absorbed by a detector.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Uncertainty principle:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;In classical physics, it is possible to know both the position and momentum of a particle with perfect accuracy. In quantum physics, there is a fundamental limit to how accurately these quantities can be known at the same time. The more accurately one quantity is known, the less accurately the other quantity can be known.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>These are just some of the key differences between classical and quantum physics. Quantum physics is a complex and fascinating subject, and there is still much that we do not understand about it. However, it is clear that quantum physics is essential for understanding the behavior of matter at the atomic and subatomic level.</em></blockquote><h2>Bing:</h2><blockquote><em>In classical physics, events (in general) are continuous, which is to say they move in smooth, orderly and predictable patterns. Projectile motion is a good example of classical mechanics. Classical mechanics describes the behavior of macroscopic bodies, which have relatively small velocities compared to the speed of light. In contrast, quantum mechanics describes the behavior of microscopic bodies such as subatomic particles, atoms, and other small bodies. These two are the most important fields in physics</em><a href=\"https://physics-network.org/what-is-the-main-difference-between-classical-physics-and-quantum-physics/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\"><em>1</em></a><em>.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>In classical physics, the outcomes of measurements can be predicted perfectly, assuming full knowledge of the system beforehand.&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://physics-network.org/what-is-the-main-difference-between-classical-physics-and-quantum-physics/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\"><em>In quantum mechanics, even if you have full knowledge of a system, the outcomes of certain measurements will be impossible to predict1</em></a><em>.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>Would you like me to look up more information?</em></blockquote><h2>Prompt 3: “Summarize the plot of the latest Marvel movie”</h2><h2>Bard:</h2><blockquote><em>The latest Marvel movie is&nbsp;</em><strong><em>“Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness”</em></strong><em>.

  "content": "<p>Using npm effectively is a cornerstone of modern web development, no matter if it's exclusively with Node.js, as a package manager or build tool for the front-end, or even as a piece of workflows in other languages and on other platforms.</p><p><em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Really</em>&nbsp;understanding npm as a tool, understanding the core concepts, can be something that's difficult for a beginner - I spent many hours just trying to figure out small details that would seem minor or be taken for granted by others.</p><p>As such, I've written up a basic and&nbsp;<strong style=\"background-color: transparent;\">detailed</strong>&nbsp;guide for understanding npm, for those who are entirely new to Node.js, npm, and the surrounding ecosystem.</p><h2>An Absolute Beginner's Guide to&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(137, 161, 157); background-color: transparent;\">package.json</code></h2><p>As a general rule, any project that's using Node.js will need to have a&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">package.json</code>&nbsp;file. What is a&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">package.json</code>&nbsp;file?</p><p>At its simplest, a&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">package.json</code>&nbsp;file can be described as a manifest of your project that includes the packages and applications it depends on, information about its unique source control, and specific metadata like the project's name, description, and author.</p><p>Let's break down the core parts of a typical&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">package.json</code>&nbsp;file:</p><p><br></p><h3>Specific Metadata: name, version, description, license, and keywords</h3><p>Inside a package.json, you'll almost always find metadata specific to the project - no matter if it's a web application, Node.js module, or even just a plain JavaScirpt library. This metadata helps identify the project and acts as a baseline for users and contributors to get information about the project.</p><p>Here's an example of how these fields would look in a package.json file:</p><pre class=\"ql-syntax\" spellcheck=\"false\">{\r\n  \"name\": \"metaverse\", // The name of your project\r\n  \"version\": \"0.92.12\", // The version of your project\r\n  \"description\": \"The Metaverse virtual reality. The final outcome of all virtual worlds, augmented reality, and the Internet.\", // The description of your project\r\n  \"main\": \"index.js\"\r\n  \"license\": \"MIT\" // The license of your project\r\n}\r\n</pre><p>A&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">package.json</code>&nbsp;file is&nbsp;<em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">always</em>&nbsp;structured in the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.json.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(76, 88, 89); background-color: transparent;\">JSON</a>&nbsp;format, which allows it to be easily read as metadata and parsed by machines.</p><p>If needing to format a&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">package.json</code>&nbsp;file manually to get your project up and running seems a bit daunting, there's a handy command that will automatically generate a base&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">package.json</code>&nbsp;file for you - if you'd like to learn how to use it, take a peek at the&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">npm init</code>&nbsp;instructions below!</p><h3>Understanding and Managing Your Project's Dependencies:&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(137, 161, 157); background-color: transparent;\">dependencies</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(137, 161, 157); background-color: transparent;\">devDepenendcies</code>&nbsp;in your&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(137, 161, 157); background-color: transparent;\">package.json</code></h3><p>The other majorly important aspect of a&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">package.json</code>&nbsp;is that it contains a collection of any given project's dependencies. These dependencies are the modules that the project relies on to function properly.</p><p>Having dependencies in your project's&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">package.json</code>&nbsp;allows the project to install the versions of the modules it depends on. By running an install command (see the instructions for&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">npm install</code>&nbsp;below) inside of a project, you can install&nbsp;<em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">all</em>&nbsp;of the dependencies that are listed in the project's&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">package.json</code>&nbsp;- meaning they don't have to be (and almost never should be) bundled with the project itself.</p><p>Second, it allows the separation of dependencies that are needed for production and dependencies that are needed for development. In production, you're likely not going to need a tool to watch your CSS files for changes and refresh the app when they change. But in both production and development, you'll want to have the modules that enable what you're trying to accomplish with your project - things like your web framework, API tools, and code utilities.</p><p>What would a project's&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">package.json</code>&nbsp;look like with&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">dependencies</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">devDependencies</code>? Let's expand on the previous example of a&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">package.json</code>&nbsp;to include some.</p><pre class=\"ql-syntax\" spellcheck=\"false\">{\r\n  \"name\": \"metaverse\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.92.12\",\r\n  \"description\": \"The Metaverse virtual reality.

Every key in both&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">dependencies</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">devDependencies</code>&nbsp;is a name of a package, and every value is the version range that's acceptable to install (according to Semantic Versioning - to learn more about Semantic Versioning, also known as semver, check out our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nodesource.com/blog/semver-a-primer/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(76, 88, 89); background-color: transparent;\">primer on semver</a>).</p><p>Can't get enough npm?

As such, here's a detailed rundown of the commands that you'll encounter and need to use most frequently.</p><h2>Using&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(137, 161, 157); background-color: transparent;\">npm init</code>&nbsp;to Initialize a Project</h2><p>The&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">npm init</code>&nbsp;command is a step-by-step tool to scaffold out your project. It will prompt you for input for a few aspects of the project in the following order:</p><ul><li>The project's name,</li><li>The project's initial version,</li><li>The project's description,</li><li>The project's entry point (meaning the project's main file),</li><li>The project's test command (to trigger testing with something like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/feross/standard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(76, 88, 89); background-color: transparent;\">Standard</a>)</li><li>The project's git repository (where the project source can be found)</li><li>The project's keywords (basically, tags related to the project)</li><li>The project's license (this defaults to ISC - most open-source Node.js projects are MIT)</li></ul><p>It's worth noting that if you're content with the&nbsp;<em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">suggestion</em>&nbsp;that the&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">npm init</code>&nbsp;command provides next to the prompt, you can simply hit&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">Return</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">Enter</code>&nbsp;to accept the suggestion and move on to the next prompt.</p><p>Once you run through the&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">npm init</code>&nbsp;steps above, a&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">package.json</code>&nbsp;file will be generated and placed in the current directory. If you run it in a directory that's not exclusively for your project, don't worry! Generating a&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">package.json</code>&nbsp;doesn't really&nbsp;<em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">do</em>&nbsp;anything, other than create a&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">package.json</code>&nbsp;file. You can either move the&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">package.json</code>&nbsp;file to a directory that's dedicated to your project,&nbsp;<em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">or</em>&nbsp;you can create an entirely new one in such a directory.</p><h4>HOW TO USE&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(137, 161, 157); background-color: transparent;\">NPM INIT</code>:</h4><pre class=\"ql-syntax\" spellcheck=\"false\">npm init # This will trigger the initialization\r\n</pre><h3>Using&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(137, 161, 157); background-color: transparent;\">npm init --yes</code>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Instantly</em>&nbsp;Initialize a Project</h3><p>If you want to get on to building your project, and don't want to spend the (albeit brief) time answering the prompts that come from&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">npm init</code>, you can use the&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">--yes</code>&nbsp;flag on the&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">npm init</code>&nbsp;command to automatically populate all options with the default&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">npm init</code>&nbsp;values.</p><blockquote><strong style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Note:</strong>&nbsp;You can configure what these default values are with the npm configuration - that's a more advanced topic, and outside the scope of this beginner's guide to npm.</blockquote><blockquote>That said, if you're interested in setting that up, you can learn how to set these defaults in the eleventh tip of our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nodesource.com/blog/eleven-npm-tricks-that-will-knock-your-wombat-socks-off\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(76, 88, 89); background-color: transparent;\">npm tricks</a>&nbsp;article.</blockquote><h4>USAGE:</h4><pre class=\"ql-syntax\" spellcheck=\"false\">npm init --yes # This will trigger automatically populated initialization.\r\n</pre><h2>Install Modules with&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(137, 161, 157); background-color: transparent;\">npm install</code></h2><p>Installing modules from npm is one of the most basic things you should learn to do when getting started with npm. As you dive deeper, you'll begin to learn some variations on installing modules, but here's the very core of what you need to know to install a standalone module into the current directory:</p><pre class=\"ql-syntax\" spellcheck=\"false\">npm install &lt;module&gt;\r\n</pre><p>In the above command, you'd replace&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">&lt;module&gt;</code>&nbsp;with the name of the module you want to install. For example, if you want to install Express (the most used and most well known Node.js web framework), you could run the following command:</p><pre class=\"ql-syntax\" spellcheck=\"false\">npm install express\r\n</pre><p>The above command will install the&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">express</code>&nbsp;module into&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">/node_modules</code>&nbsp;in the current directory. Whenever you install a module from npm, it will be installed&nbsp;<em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">into</em>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">node_modules</code>&nbsp;folder.</p><p>In addition to triggering an install of a single module, you can actually trigger the installation of&nbsp;<em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">all</em>&nbsp;modules that are listed as&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">dependencies</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">devDependencies</code>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">package.json</code>&nbsp;in the current directory. To do so, you'll simply need to run the command itself:</p><pre class=\"ql-syntax\" spellcheck=\"false\">npm install\r\n</pre><p>Once you run this, npm will begin the installation process of all of the current project's dependencies.</p><p>As an aside, one thing to note is that there's an alias for&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">npm install</code>&nbsp;that you may see in the wild when working with modules from the ecosystem. The alias is&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">npm i</code>, where&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">i</code>&nbsp;takes the place of&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">install</code>.</p><p>This seemingly minor alias is a small gotcha for beginners - including myself, several times when I was learning - to the Node.js and npm ecosystems, as there's not a standardized, single way that module creators and maintainers will instruct on how to install their module.</p><h4>USAGE:</h4><pre class=\"ql-syntax\" spellcheck=\"false\">npm install &lt;module&gt; # Where &lt;module&gt; is the name of the module you want to install\r\nnpm i &lt;module&gt; # Where &lt;module&gt; is the name of the module you want to install - using the i alias for installation\r\n</pre><h3>Install modules and save them to your&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(137, 161, 157); background-color: transparent;\">package.json</code>&nbsp;as a dependency</h3><p>As with&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">npm init</code>, the&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">npm install</code>&nbsp;command has a flag or two that you'll find useful in your workflow - it'll save you time and effort with regard to your project's&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">package.json</code>&nbsp;file.</p><p>When you're running&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">npm install</code>&nbsp;to install a module, you can add the optional flag&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">--save</code>&nbsp;to the command. This flag will add the module as a dependency of your project to the project's&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">package.json</code>&nbsp;as an entry in&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">dependencies</code>.</p><h4>USAGE:</h4><pre class=\"ql-syntax\" spellcheck=\"false\">npm install &lt;module&gt; --save # Where &lt;module&gt; is the name of the module you want to install\r\n</pre><h3>Install Modules and Save Them to Your&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(137, 161, 157); background-color: transparent;\">package.json</code>&nbsp;as a Developer dependency</h3><p>There's a flag that is nearly an exact duplicate, in terms of functionality, of the&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">--save</code>&nbsp;flag when installing a module:&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">--save-dev</code>. There are a few a key differences between the two - instead of saving the module being installed and added to&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">package.json</code>&nbsp;as an entry in&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">dependencies</code>, it will save it as an entry in the&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">devDependencies</code>.</p><p>The semantic difference here is that&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">dependencies</code>&nbsp;are for use in production - whatever that would entail for your project. On the other hand,&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">devDependencies</code>&nbsp;are a collection of the dependencies that are used in&nbsp;<em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">development</em>&nbsp;of your application - the modules that you use to build it, but don't need to use when it's&nbsp;<em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">running</em>. This could include things like testing tools, a local server to speed up your development, and more.</p><h4>USAGE:</h4><pre class=\"ql-syntax\" spellcheck=\"false\">npm install &lt;module&gt; --save-dev # Where &lt;module&gt; is the name of the module you want to install\r\n</pre><h3>Install Modules Globally on your System</h3><p>The final, and most common, flag for&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">npm install</code>&nbsp;that you should are the flags to install a module globally on your system.</p><p>Global modules can be extremely useful - there are tons tools, utilities, and more for both development and general usage that you can install globally to use.</p><p>To install a module from npm globally, you'll simply need to use the&nbsp;<code style=\"color: rgb(77, 153, 140); background-color: transparent;\">--global</code>&nbsp;flag when running the install command to have the module install globally, rather than locally (to the current directory).</p><blockquote><strong style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Note:</strong>&nbsp;One caveat with global modules is that, by default, npm will install them to a system directory, not a local one.

  "title": "Next js vs React: Comparing Two Popular Frontend Frameworks",
  "content": "<p>When it comes to having your own website or web application, it is now more of a necessity for all businesses. Choosing the right kind of technology is important to garner a good user experience and interface. Two technologies that are often being compared are&nbsp;<strong>Next js vs React</strong>. One is a framework, and the other is a library, yet they are contrasted.</p><p>Both are accountable for delivering a high-quality experience for users in terms of an effective front end and a great digital experience.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.spec-india.com/services/reactjs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(25, 133, 191);\">Reactjs</a>&nbsp;is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces whereas Next.js is a production framework for React. Next.js is created on top of React and hence makes use of React whereas React doesn’t need Next.js for functioning.</p><p>This article focuses on the basics of what is Next.js, what is React.js, their features, advantages, disadvantages, organizations using them when to use what, etc.</p><h2><strong>What Is Next.js?</strong></h2><p>Created by Vercel, Next.js is a new-age open-source framework that works on top of React. It aims to make web processes faster and consists of tools that are needed for the web. Along with Node.js, it helps in building server-side apps or hybrid static apps.</p><p>It offers a proper structure to the application and routes the pages via a simplified file folder system. It is meant to create SEO-based websites, landing pages, fast and higher-load web applications, eCommerce apps, etc.</p><p>As a lightweight framework, it offers static site and server-side rendering because of which it offers speedy web apps. There are comprehensively pre-rendered HTML pages through which users and bots interact with each other.</p><p>Next.js creates applications that are ready for production and offer exemplary features like smart bundling, server-side rendering, etc. It involves the creation of applications wherein there are a huge number of users involved with complicated data inflow.</p><h4><strong>Next Js Features:</strong></h4><ul><li>Pre-rendering through server-side rendering and static generation</li><li>Support for TypeScript making it liked more by developers</li><li>Continuous support for Redux</li><li>Configurable as per needs with simple routing mechanisms</li><li>Automated build size optimization</li><li>Quicker development compilation</li><li>Ideal for developing landing pages of applications</li><li>Creates good and fast marketing websites</li><li>Excellent support for SEO-based websites and applications</li></ul><h2><strong>What Is React.js?</strong></h2><p>Powered by Facebook, React.js is a popular, open-source&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.spec-india.com/services/javascript-development\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(25, 133, 191);\">JavaScript&nbsp;</a>library that is used to create interactive user interfaces with ease. It is a simplified frontend development library that gels well with React Native and Redux for the creation of user interfaces.</p><p>Since the components are declarative in nature and scalable, they are the best fit for complicated applications also. Developers can create SEO-friendly applications, dynamic mobile apps, interactive dashboards, SPA, etc.</p><p>React.js facilitates developers to write the code only once and use it at multiple places, anytime and anywhere. It makes use of JavaScript or TypeScript to build components. It uses a reactive methodology with a functional programming concept.</p><p>React has carved a niche for itself in the software development tools arena. Being a flexible and exhaustive library, with the aid of other tools like Redux, React.js has been able to showcase multiple features that attract developers.</p><blockquote><em>Good Read:&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.spec-india.com/blog/reactjs-developer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(25, 133, 191);\"><em>ReactJS Developer: Role, Responsibilities, Skills, Salary And Lot More</em></a></blockquote><h4><strong>React Js Features:</strong></h4><ul><li>One-way data binding</li><li>Virtual DOM</li><li>Offers extensions covering application architecture</li><li>Provides speed, simplicity, performance</li><li>Write code for building blocks of React UI</li><li>Effective component architecture</li><li>Less coding through function components</li><li>Complete power of JavaScript through JSX</li><li>Addition of opt-in features through Hooks API</li></ul><h3><strong>Next js vs React Advantages</strong></h3><h5><strong>Advantages of Next js –</strong></h5><p>There are evident reasons why Next.js is so popular and here are the key advantages of Next js that are enjoyed by developers:</p><ul><li>Easy coding mechanism, needs less code, and has enhanced legibility</li><li>Server-side rendering and Static Generation leading to faster performance</li><li>Instant visibility to file changes on page refresh</li><li>Easy customization, import of CSS styles from JavaScript files</li><li>Enhanced optimization of images with modernized formats</li><li>Simple deployment mechanism with the fast launch of applications</li><li>Seamless connection with third-party APIs, creating API routes</li><li>Tools and bundlers included in the initial configuration setup</li><li>Better SEO results, faster crawling, and rankings</li></ul><h5><strong>Advantages of React –</strong></h5><p>React has always been a popular technology and below mentioned are the major advantages of React, that have attracted developers</p><ul><li>Relies on JavaScript, has good documentation, and is easy to learn</li><li>Pre-packaged scripts with tools such as Create React App for faster execution</li><li>Reusable components to create flexible web applications</li><li>Easy and less coding with faster creation of dynamic apps</li><li>Strong community support with effective resources to assist</li><li>Visibility of changes across pages by editing the main component code</li><li>Customization is made easy with integration with other tools like Redux</li><li>Variety of training material, tutorials, and documentation for easy grasping</li><li>Effective SEO optimization with better results</li></ul><h3><strong>Next.js vs React Disadvantages</strong></h3><h5><strong>Next js Disadvantages –</strong></h5><ul><li>Does not support dynamic routing</li><li>Takes a long to create larger sites</li><li>Lesser community support</li></ul><h5><strong>Disadvantages of React –</strong></h5><ul><li>Takes a longer time to be interactive</li><li>Must depend upon other tools since it covers only UI layers</li><li>Constantly updating documentation for up-to-date information</li></ul><h3><strong>Next Js vs React Alternatives</strong></h3><h5><strong>Next js Alternatives –</strong></h5><p>Here are the possible and popular Next js alternatives:</p><p><strong>Create React App, Hugo, Gatsby, React Router, React, Angular Universal, LoopBack, RemixJS, etc.</strong></p><h5><strong>React Alternatives –</strong></h5><p>Here are the possible and popular React alternatives:</p><p><strong>Angular, Ember.js, NativeScript, jQuery, Vue.js, Preact, Next.js, Mithril, InfernoJS, Xamarin, etc.</strong></p>",

  "content": "<p>There could be a moment when a certain app update or a bug could eradicate a user’s smartphone data including images and videos. As a result, the loss can be irreparable.

However, we have handpicked few of them and they are jotted as under:</p><ul><li>Imgur</li><li>Flickr</li><li>PhotoBucket</li><li>500PX</li></ul><p>All aforementioned websites include adverts. Surely, that is not a problem as long as there are no uploading charges. A user gets a storage of 20GB on Imgur while Flickr permits users to upload as many as 1,000 photos or 1TB of data [whichever option is obtained first]. PhotoBucket lets users upload 250 images while 500PX empowers seven uploads per week.</p><p>There’s one obstacle to these free websites and it is that they come with limited uploading restrictions.

If files are big enough in size, it will cut it into your free 15GB of Google storage. The payment plans are cheaper as compared to other paid services. Conversely, iOS users are comfortable using iCloud as it gives up a free storage of 2GB. A user can definitely pay to acquire more GBs though.</p>",

Let’s look at the three key ways white papers can help you promote your business, products, or services.</p><h3><strong>WHITE PAPERS AS THOUGHT LEADERSHIP PUBLICATION</strong></h3><p>White papers are not “salesy” documents. They’re meant to be informative. And the reason they’re such effective PR tools is because they help position companies, and their owners or executives, as thought leaders in their industries.</p><p>In other words, white papers should convey authority. They should address real problems in convincing and thought-provoking ways – not simply regurgitate basic information already published elsewhere.</p><h3><strong>WHITE PAPERS AS LEAD GENERATORS</strong></h3><p>While some companies make their white papers freely-available to download, they’re more often used to generate sales leads. The downloads are still free, but you would collect contact information for your marketing list before providing the download links.</p><p>Is this tactic effective? Well, when&nbsp;<a href=\"http://e61c88871f1fbaa6388d-c1e3bb10b0333d7ff7aa972d61f8c669.r29.cf1.rackcdn.com/DGR_DG076_SURV_ContentPref_March_2018_Final.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(3, 135, 7);\"><strong>75% of B2B respondents</strong></a>&nbsp;report they’re willing to part with their information for access to white papers, the answer is a resounding “yes.”</p><h3><strong>WHITE PAPERS AS PERSUASIVE SALES TOOLS</strong></h3><p>While white papers are primarily informative in nature, there is a sales component, usually at the end. This is where the company providing that information aims to convert readers into buyers. We’ll look at that more shortly.</p><h3><strong>THINK OF A WHITE PAPER AS A CONVERSATION</strong></h3><p>White papers can be long. They should be authoritative. And they can be incredibly important in certain sales channels. But that doesn’t mean they have to be complicated.</p><p>We’ll look at how to outline a basic white paper in a moment. But before we get there, think about it like a conversation first. This is basically what should happen when you have a well-written white paper:</p><p><strong>YOU:&nbsp;</strong>“Were you aware X is a huge opportunity for your business to shine, and you’re not taking advantage of it yet?”</p><p><strong>READER:&nbsp;</strong>“Well, gosh. I didn’t realize. But are you sure&nbsp;<em>my&nbsp;</em>particular business could take advantage of this opportunity?”</p><p><strong>YOU:&nbsp;</strong>“Yep! I’m 100% sure, and here’s the data to prove it.”</p><p><strong>READER:&nbsp;</strong>“Awesome. I guess I should do something about this then. Any idea how to go about it?”</p><p><strong>YOU:&nbsp;</strong>“You bet! As an authority in this area, here’s the solution or steps I suggest.”</p><p><strong>READER:&nbsp;</strong>“Fantastic. I’m ready to get started, but I could use a hand from a pro. Know anyone who can help?”</p><p><strong>YOU:&nbsp;</strong>“As it just so happens, I’m your guy / gal. Let’s talk about how I can help you.”</p><p>Now let’s look at how you can take this hypothetical conversation and turn it into a more formal outline for your white paper.</p><h2><strong>HOW TO WRITE A WHITE PAPER: THE OUTLINE</strong></h2><p>First, you should know there’s no single right way to write a white paper. Some traditional versions will follow an outline like the one below rather strictly.</p><p>Others will stray from that traditional style – be list-oriented, feature more technical specs, involve more industry insight, or be more heavily research-oriented for example.</p><iframe class=\"ql-video ql-align-center\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-7563135538633152&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=2300323585&amp;adf=3029704244&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3469987596~i.59~rp.4&amp;w=764&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1680225960&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=3513670988&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=764x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpakwired.com%2Fhow-to-write-a-white-paper%2F&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=191&amp;rw=764&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;uach=WyJXaW5kb3dzIiwiMTAuMC4wIiwieDg2IiwiIiwiMTExLjAuNTU2My4xNDciLFtdLGZhbHNlLG51bGwsIjY0IixbWyJHb29nbGUgQ2hyb21lIiwiMTExLjAuNTU2My4xNDciXSxbIk5vdChBOkJyYW5kIiwiOC4wLjAuMCJdLFsiQ2hyb21pdW0iLCIxMTEuMC41NTYzLjE0NyJdXSxmYWxzZV0.&amp;dt=1680225960020&amp;bpp=3&amp;bdt=936&amp;idt=3&amp;shv=r20230329&amp;mjsv=m202303280101&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D1a5a7aeb13878091-22056d2a4adc0007%3AT%3D1680225694%3ART%3D1680225694%3AS%3DALNI_MbTkWchp4oJLTRW6oaowfsLxhzQCw&amp;gpic=UID%3D00000bf8fcb28eea%3AT%3D1680225694%3ART%3D1680225694%3AS%3DALNI_MbdBHreE3ddKM1zbKYd7UbySLhpcw&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C764x280%2C764x280%2C270x600&amp;nras=5&amp;correlator=8249953350681&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=378548323.1680225677&amp;ga_sid=1680225959&amp;ga_hid=632789501&amp;ga_fc=1&amp;u_tz=300&amp;u_his=12&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=728&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_sd=1&amp;dmc=8&amp;adx=135&amp;ady=2863&amp;biw=1349&amp;bih=568&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=594&amp;eid=44777876%2C44759837%2C44759875%2C44759926%2C31071259%2C31073508%2C44774606%2C31073347%2C21065724&amp;oid=2&amp;pvsid=2289219808745516&amp;tmod=1839296399&amp;uas=3&amp;nvt=1&amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Fpakwired.com%2Ftopic%2Fguides%2Fpage%2F3%2F&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C1366%2C0%2C1366%2C728%2C1366%2C568&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=128&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=4&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=fv6GyAce6l&amp;p=https%3A//pakwired.com&amp;dtd=18880\" height=\"0\" width=\"764\"></iframe><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p>But these basic elements will appear in most white papers in some format or another.

That data should not only support your claim, but it should also create a sense of urgency in the reader.</p><h3><strong>3. ADDITIONAL / RELATED PROBLEMS</strong></h3><p>This is an area that commonly appears in white papers, but it isn’t always necessary.</p><p>Sometimes the main problem or opportunity you’re focused on has related ones attached to it. It can pay to highlight them, though less in-depth, because different issues are going to be more and less persuasive to different readers.</p><p>For example, let’s say your white paper is related to medical equipment your company sells to hospitals. The main problem or opportunity might have to do with research and testing showing your equipment is more effective at treating patients than the current standard.</p><p>In this example, a secondary problem or opportunity might have to do with the cost to the hospitals. Perhaps existing methods or equipment require significant upkeep costs or are very costly to replace, and your newer option would not only help more patients but also save on overhead.</p><h3><strong>4. YOUR GENERAL PROPOSED SOLUTION</strong></h3><p>Once you’ve demonstrated to readers there is a problem, and you’ve convinced them they want to solve it, your white paper should tell them&nbsp;<em>how</em>.</p><p>Don’t pitch your company or your products yet though. You won’t usually even mention them by name here.</p><p>Instead, when you write a white paper, you’ll want to present a more general solution first. Take the medical equipment company from the example above.</p><p>In that company’s case, they won’t pitch their product here. Instead, they’ll describe the&nbsp;<em>type&nbsp;</em>of equipment or technology that can solve the hospital administrators’ problems.</p><p>A white paper should be progressively persuasive. You build trust by writing in an authoritative way. You present a true solution to a problem. And only&nbsp;<em>then&nbsp;</em>do you go for the sale.</p><h3><strong>5. YOUR CALL-TO-ACTION</strong></h3><p>After you’ve convinced your white paper’s reader that you understand their needs and you’ve shown them a viable solution, you’re finally ready to make your pitch.</p><p>This section is more directly sales-oriented, not only describing your product or service but featuring your call-to-action (CTA).</p><p>This section will often range from around ½ to 1 page. And it’s where you’ll prompt your reader to take further action. Depending on what you’re selling, you might link them to a place where they can make a purchase immediately. But for larger-ticket products and services, you’ll generally nudge them to contact you for more information in a sales call.</p><iframe class=\"ql-video ql-align-center\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-7563135538633152&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=2300323585&amp;adf=1637095544&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3469987596~i.121~rp.4&amp;w=764&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1680225960&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=3513670988&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=764x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpakwired.com%2Fhow-to-write-a-white-paper%2F&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=191&amp;rw=764&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;uach=WyJXaW5kb3dzIiwiMTAuMC4wIiwieDg2IiwiIiwiMTExLjAuNTU2My4xNDciLFtdLGZhbHNlLG51bGwsIjY0IixbWyJHb29nbGUgQ2hyb21lIiwiMTExLjAuNTU2My4xNDciXSxbIk5vdChBOkJyYW5kIiwiOC4wLjAuMCJdLFsiQ2hyb21pdW0iLCIxMTEuMC41NTYzLjE0NyJdXSxmYWxzZV0.&amp;dt=1680225960061&amp;bpp=5&amp;bdt=977&amp;idt=5&amp;shv=r20230329&amp;mjsv=m202303280101&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D1a5a7aeb13878091-22056d2a4adc0007%3AT%3D1680225694%3ART%3D1680225694%3AS%3DALNI_MbTkWchp4oJLTRW6oaowfsLxhzQCw&amp;gpic=UID%3D00000bf8fcb28eea%3AT%3D1680225694%3ART%3D1680225694%3AS%3DALNI_MbdBHreE3ddKM1zbKYd7UbySLhpcw&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C764x280%2C764x280%2C270x600%2C764x280%2C764x280%2C764x280%2C764x280&amp;nras=9&amp;correlator=8249953350681&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=378548323.1680225677&amp;ga_sid=1680225959&amp;ga_hid=632789501&amp;ga_fc=1&amp;u_tz=300&amp;u_his=12&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=728&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_sd=1&amp;dmc=8&amp;adx=135&amp;ady=4969&amp;biw=1349&amp;bih=568&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=2724&amp;eid=44777876%2C44759837%2C44759875%2C44759926%2C31071259%2C31073508%2C44774606%2C31073347%2C21065724&amp;oid=2&amp;pvsid=2289219808745516&amp;tmod=1839296399&amp;uas=3&amp;nvt=1&amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Fpakwired.com%2Ftopic%2Fguides%2Fpage%2F3%2F&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C1366%2C0%2C1366%2C728%2C1366%2C568&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=128&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=8&amp;uci=a!8&amp;btvi=8&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=zdbn0MCRVL&amp;p=https%3A//pakwired.com&amp;dtd=22995\" height=\"0\" width=\"764\"></iframe><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p>This is when your reader either converts into a customer or a hotter lead.</p><h2><strong>HOW TO WRITE A WHITE PAPER: BASIC FORMATTING TIPS</strong></h2><p>When it comes to how to write a white paper, you now understand the type of content you’ll want to include. But what should it look like?</p><p>Here are some simple formatting tips to help you prepare your new white paper for publication.</p><h3><strong>HOW LONG SHOULD A WHITE PAPER BE?</strong></h3><p>There is no correct length for a white paper.</p><p>Some are as short as 5 pages. Others run 10-20 pages. This will vary quite a bit based on your industry, the type of buyer you’re trying to reach, and what you’re promoting.</p><p>According to white paper writer and author of&nbsp;<em>White Papers for Dummies</em>, Gordon Graham,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thatwhitepaperguy.com/white-paper-faq-frequently-asked-questions/#blog_post\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(3, 135, 7);\"><strong>white papers are usually 3000-5000 words</strong></a>. So that gives you something to aim for.</p><h3><strong>WHAT SHOULD A WHITE PAPER LOOK LIKE?</strong></h3><p>When thinking about how to write a white paper, you’ll want to keep structure in mind. Think of it in terms of a report.</p><p>Paragraphs and sections should be long enough to say what needs to be said, but short enough that the overall content is “scannable.” This means you’ll break it up with things like lists and headings when appropriate.</p><p>You should include images, but don’t go overboard. The content is the most important thing. Make sure any images you use are relevant, necessary, or otherwise help make the content easier to understand.</p><p>For example, skip the stock images, and focus instead on relevant charts, graphs, or images directly illustrating the problem or solution.</p><p>Now that you’ve learned some of the basics of how to write a white paper, what are you waiting for? Brainstorm some topic ideas and figure out how white papers can fit into your content marketing strategy.</p>",

  "title": "How Google Maps Calculates Traffic Jams",
  "content": "<p>Recently, Berlin artist Simon Weckert ‘<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/style/article/artist-google-traffic-jam-alert-trick-scli-intl/index.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(3, 135, 7);\"><strong>hacked</strong></a>‘ Google Maps by dragging a cart full of 99 iPhones running the app around the city. He practically deceived&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pakwired.com/new-feature-for-ios-version-of-google-maps-rolled-out/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(3, 135, 7);\"><strong>Google Maps</strong></a>&nbsp;into thinking there was an actual traffic jam, when in fact there was none.</p><p>Though it’s a clever trick, it raises important questions about how Google Maps keeps track of the data it collects in ordinary traffic conditions. If the stunt pulled off by Weckert is able to fool Google Maps’ system, can you always be certain about the app’s accuracy? From what we know about the app’s algorithm and Google’s responses to Weckert’s stunt, the answer is apparently: yes,&nbsp;<em>mostly</em>.</p><h2><strong>HOW GOOGLE MAPS DISPLAYS TRAFFIC JAMS</strong></h2><p>Google Maps continuously refreshes based on anonymously-tracked user data, traffic sensors and satellite data to ensure the most accurate traffic conditions are being displayed.</p><p>You may have seen streets coloured green, orange or red. Green means the traffic is normal but orange and red indicate slow-downs. They show up when users in navigation mode are travelling slower-then-usual. Once other drivers using Google Maps are able to wade through at normal speeds, however, Google will gradually remove the slow-down status for the area even if others are still slowly driving.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p>According to 9to5Google’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2020/02/04/google-maps-hack-virtual-traffic-jam/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(3, 135, 7);\"><strong>report</strong></a>&nbsp;on Weckert’s stunt, it took just a single car driving past him at normal speed to undo the traffic jam status which was caused by his cart of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pakwired.com/is-a-satellite-enabled-data-sharing-mechanism-for-iphones-in-the-works/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(3, 135, 7);\"><strong>iPhones</strong></a>. Having said so, apparently Google Maps ignores when several users are at a standstill. Weckert’s wagon had to be moving for Google Maps to see the traffic jam despite the fact that nearly 100 phones were in navigation mode and not moving. It’s unclear how long a vehicle should be idling before it’s ignored; Google Maps will obviously notice if several users were stopped on a highway and reported that as a slow-down. However, if a group of people parked in a garage just had their navigation mode turned on, you probably wouldn’t see any traffic jams in the area.</p><p>Google Maps can tell the difference between a car, motorcycle and other vehicles (well, atleast in some countries). Even if a cheeky scooter weaves its way through a traffic jam, Google Maps could, in such a case, recognise the smaller vehicle’s movement and not register it as smooth flow of traffic.</p><h2><strong>ACCIDENTS, CONSTRUCTION AND TRAFFIC INCIDENTS</strong></h2><p>Google Maps also updates with traffic reports based on user feedback apart from parallel, anonymised location and movement tracking to keep conditions updated.</p><p>Accidents, construction sites, speed traps and other alerts can all be reported in the app. The more users reporting an alert makes it show faster on the map for others and help them avoid slow-downs to find better routes. Here’s how to report traffic incidents and slow-downs if you’re unfamiliar:</p><ul><li>In Google Maps’ navigation mode, tap the “+” icon.</li><li>Tap the icon for the type of incident you want to report and follow on-screen instructions to finalise submission.</li></ul><p>The app will begin adding your report to the map and you can undo the process during a very short timeframe.</p><h2><strong>CALCULATING REROUTES AND ETA</strong></h2><p>Google compares the speed of its users with speed limit information to calculate the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA).</p><p>Google Maps will also cross-reference conditions reported by users and other traffic data with your current speed to adjust your arrival times if it notices a slow-down or other incidents along the route. Once the app determines the severity and length of a slow-down, it alerts users whose routes are affected and suggests alternative directions (reroutes).</p>",

  "title": "You Can Now Restore Data From A Google Account On Android 8.1 Even After a Factory Reset",
  "content": "<p>When it comes to backing up and restoring data, Android does not have a good reputation of handling it. However, the recent versions have been a lot of better as they offer these options to the users. Since the Marshmallow update, automatic app data backups have made switching between phones much easier. Subsequently, it brings all the apps and settings with the users. According to a recent development,&nbsp;<strong>Android 8.1</strong>&nbsp;will let you restore data from a Google account even if you select to skip the option during initial setup.

  "title": "What Will Happen After Death According to Islam",
  "content": "<p>Death is often a frightening thought, but one that we should not be scared of. When you truly understand death you will no longer have to be scared of it.</p><p>When we are able to understand that Allah (SWT) made this Dunya (Arabic for the temporal world) a test for the believers and that this is not our real home; you will truly be able to find peace within your heart. You think that death is scary, but this Dunya is scarier. The reality of this Dunya is that we often excuse our poor behaviour of the neglection of Allah (SWT) due to our worldly responsibilities.</p><p>You may be thinking well what will happen after death in Islam [link here]. In Islamic tradition, the following is what occurs after an individual passes away. The occurrence is not always as you may expect, and it can strike you at any time whether you like it or not. Allah (SWT) sends his angel Azreal, known as the angel of death, to retrieve the soul from the human. After Allah (SWT) has instructed Azreal (AS) to take your soul, you are then declared dead in the world of the Dunya.&nbsp;</p><p>“Allah takes the souls at the time of their death.” 39:42, Holy Quran</p><p>After you have died, your family and Muslim community will conduct your Ghusl (full-body ritual purification) and then proceed to your Janazah (funeral prayer) which is a part of the Islamic funeral rituals. After this and many prayers, your body is then buried six-foot underground, alone and by itself.</p><p>After some time in your grave, you are then visited by two angels, known as Munkar and Nakir. They are assigned to test the faith of those dead within their graves. When they arrive, they sit you up in your grave and ask you the following: “Who is your Lord? Who is your Prophet? And what is your faith?”.&nbsp;</p><p>When this is completed, you have been determined to either rest in peace until the day of judgement or you are severely punished by the angels until Allah (SWT) determines otherwise, until the day of resurrection. You will have now entered the stage of Barzakh, the veil or barrier which stands between two things that are not able to meet. You can easily interpret this stage as a waiting period until the day of judgement, a separation between the living and the hereafter.&nbsp;</p><p>“That I might do righteousness in that which I left behind. No! It is only a word he is saying, and behind them is a barrier until the Day they are resurrected.” – (23:100) the Holy Quran.</p><p>The stage of Barzakh is a world similar to this world, but different. The treatment and style of living they receive with the inter-space of Barzakh is a reflection of their deeds and actions performed in the Dunya. It is believed that if the individual was a firm and devout servant of Allah (SWT), they are expected to receive many pleasures during this middle stage. If they have committed many sins or are kafirs (disbelievers), they will face a hard time during this stage.</p><p>When Allah (SWT) commands this stage to be over, the day of resurrection will arrive and all of Allah's (SWT) creations will be brought before him to be judged.</p><h3><strong>Day of Judgement (Qiyamah)</strong></h3><p>It is not known to man when the day of judgement will occur, however, our beloved Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) has told us the signs which will occur in preparation for this day. There are many minor and major signs which will indicate that the time is near. The most well-known of them will be the appearance of the Dajjal (False-Messiah) and the return of Prophet Isa (Jesus) (AS).</p><p>The day, which will last 50,000 years, is a day in which Muslims spend their whole lives preparing for. All of mankind will come bearing the book of what they did within their lives; all their sins and good deeds will be judged by the ultimate judge.</p><p>The day of resurrection is the final test all of creation will have to face before they reach their final destination for eternity, whether that be hell or heaven. In Islam, we believe that we will all be resurrected according to the way we lived and the way we died. Whether that be in good deeds or sins, Allah (SWT) will bring you back to that state.</p><p>We pray that Allah (SWT) makes our journey across the Sirat (bridge) to paradise easy and prevents us from falling into the fires of hell.</p><h3><strong>Preparing for Death in Islam</strong></h3><p>Performing good deeds is the best way to make your journey in the afterlife a simple one. It is narrated that the Prophet (PBUH) said that \"when a man dies, his deeds come to an end except for three things: Sadaqah Jariyah (a continuous charity), a knowledge which is beneficial, or a virtuous descendant who prays for him.\" – Muslim</p><p>Preparing an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.muslimaid.org/wills-and-legacy/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(87, 120, 40);\">Islamic will&nbsp;</a>is also an important way to prepare for your departure from this world, as it is a clear indication and testament to your decisions and your commitment to the Islamic requirements. A will helps you to take care of your family after you pass, allowing you to obtain good deeds.</p><p>Other ways that rewards can be earned after you have passed include charity (<a href=\"https://www.muslimaid.org/campaigns/sadaqah-jariyah/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(87, 120, 40);\">Sadaqah Jariyah</a>), gifting a Qur'an, and building a mosque.

  "content": "<p>There are certain days in the year which are more virtuous than others. One such day is the 10th of Muharram which is known as the day of ‘Ashura. Following are 10 virtues of this day found in the Qur’an and Sunnah:</p><h3><strong>1. It is in a sacred month</strong></h3><p>Allah mentions in the Qur’an that there are 4 sacred months:</p><p><strong>“Indeed, the number of months with Allah is twelve [lunar] months in the register of Allah [from] the day He created the heavens and the earth; of these, four are sacred.” (Surah At-Tawbah, Verse 36)</strong></p><p>And in a Hadith, the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) is reported to have said,&nbsp;<strong>“The year is twelve months of which four are sacred, the three consecutive months of Dhul-Qa’dah, Dhul-Hijjah and Muharram, and Rajab Mudar which comes between Jumadah and Sha’ban.” (Sahih Al Bukhari)</strong></p><p>The 4 sacred months are: Dhul Qa’dah, Dhul Hijjah, Muharram and Rajab.</p><h3><strong>2. Prophet Musa and his people were saved on this day</strong></h3><p>On this day, Prophet Musa (peace be upon him) and the Children of Israeel were saved from Pharoah and his pursuing army.</p><p><strong>“Then We inspired to Moses, “Strike with your staff the sea,” and it parted, and each portion was like a great towering mountain. And We advanced thereto the pursuers. And We saved Moses and those with him, all together. Then We drowned the others. Indeed, in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers. And indeed, your Lord – He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.” (Surah Ash Shu’arah, Verses 63-68)</strong></p><h3><strong>3. Prophet Nuh’s Ark came to rest on Mount Judi on this day</strong></h3><p>In a narration reported by Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him), it was on this day that the Ark of Nuh (peace be upon him) came to rest on Mount Judi. (Tafsir Ibn Kathir)</p><h3><strong>4. The Prophet would fast on this day even before Prophethood</strong></h3><p><img src=\"https://muslimaid.storage.googleapis.com/upload/img_cache/file-21288-3682f79f85fe4b6c637a46dc39162149.jpg\"></p><p><br></p><p>In a hadith in the Muwatta of Imam Malik (may Allah have mercy on him), it has been mentioned that in the era of ignorance (jahiliyyah), the polythiests of Makkah would fast on this day. It may have been due to a tradition of Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him).</p><p>Imam Al Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) has said,&nbsp;<strong>“Perhaps Quraysh used to fast on that day on the basis of some past law, such as that of Ibrahim,&nbsp;upon whom be peace.”</strong></p><p>Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) would also fast on this day before prophethood.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;</span></p><h3><strong>5. Fasting on this day used to be obligatory</strong></h3><p>The significance of the 10th of Muharram was such, that it was obligatory to fast on this day. The prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and the companions would fast on this day before the obligation was abrogated by the fasts of Ramadan.</p><p>Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) narrates in a hadith:&nbsp;<strong>“Allah’s messenger ordered (the Muslims) to fast on the day of ‘Ashura, and when fasting in the month of Ramadan was prescribed, it became optional for one to fast on that day (Ashura) or not. (Sahih Al Bukhari)</strong></p><h3><strong>6. The Prophet recommended the believers to fast on this day</strong></h3><p>Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) said,&nbsp;<strong>“The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Madinah and saw the Jews fasting on the day of ‘Ashura’. He said,&nbsp;‘What is this?’&nbsp;They said, ‘This is a righteous day, it is the day when Allah saved the Children of Israel from their enemies, so Musa fasted on this day.’ He said,&nbsp;‘We have more right to Musa than you,’&nbsp;so he fasted on that day and commanded [the Muslims] to fast on that day.” Sahih Al Bukhari</strong></p><h3><strong>7. It is the best fast after Ramadan</strong></h3><p>Fasting on the 10th of Muharram (‘Ashura) is the best fast after Ramadan.</p><p><strong>“The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The best of fasting after Ramadhan is fasting Allah’s month of Muharram.” (Sahih Muslim)</strong></p><p>Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported,&nbsp;<strong>“I asked the Prophet: ‘Which Prayer is the best after the obligatory Prayers?’ He said: ‘Prayer during the mid of the night.’ I asked: ‘Which fasting is the best after that of Ramadan?’ He said, ‘The month of Allah that you call Muharram’” (Sahih Muslim)</strong></p><h3><strong>8. The Prophet prioritised it</strong></h3><p>Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) said,&nbsp;<strong>“I never saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) so keen to fast any day and give it priority over any other than this day, the day of ‘Ashura’, and this month, meaning Ramadhan.” (Sahih Al Bukhari)</strong></p><h3><strong>9. A means of expiating sins</strong></h3><p>Fasting on this day is a means of having our (minor) sins being forgiven. Tawbah (repenting) is required for major sins.</p><p>The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said,&nbsp;<strong>“Fasting the day of ‘Arafah I hope Allah will expiate thereby for the year before it and the year after it and fasting the day of ‘Ashura I hope Allah will expiate thereby for the year that came before it.” (Sahih Muslim)</strong></p><p>We should try to fast on the 10th of Muharram and on the ninth too, but we must remember that it is not obligatory though there are great virtues&nbsp;in doing so.</p><p>Imam Ash-Shafi’i (may Allah have mercy on him) has said,&nbsp;<strong>“It is mustahabb to fast on both the ninth and tenth days, because the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) fasted on the tenth and intended to fast on the ninth.”</strong></p><h3><strong>10. Spending on one’s family on this day&nbsp;brings blessings</strong></h3><p><img src=\"https://muslimaid.storage.googleapis.com/upload/img_cache/file-21290-b5753799eb3d00f521c56aa61234c7cb.jpg\"></p><p><br></p><p>There are great blessings to be attained throughout the year for the one who is extra generous to his family:</p><p>The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) is reported to have said,&nbsp;<strong>“One who generously spends on his family on ‘Ashura (10th of Muharram), Allah will be generous on him for the entire year.” (Al-Bayhaqi,&nbsp;Shu’ab al-Iman)</strong></p><p>In this regard, Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (Allah have mercy on him) quotes Sufyan ibn Uyayna (Allah have mercy on him) as saying,&nbsp;<strong>“I have practiced this [spending on the family] for fifty or sixty years and have found nothing but good in it.” (Lata’if al-Ma’arif)</strong></p><p>Courtesy of Ilmfeed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ilmfeed.com/10-virtues-of-the-10th-of-muharram-day-of-ashura/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(87, 120, 40);\">https://ilmfeed.com/10-virtues-of-the-10th-of-muharram-day-of-ashura/</a></p>",

  "title": "What is the Importance of Ramadan?",
  "content": "<p>Ramadan is the ninth month in the Islamic Hijri Calendar and is a month of fasting, repentance, and good deeds. Fasting in Ramadan upholds Sawm, one of the Pillars of Islam, which means ‘to fast’.</p><p>In this month, fasting is compulsory for every sane, non-disabled Muslim adult. Those who are excused from fasting are children who have not yet reached puberty, women who are menstruating, pregnant women, breastfeeding women, the frail and elderly, the ill, those on medication and those who are unable to fast due to health or other valid reasons.</p><p>Ramadan was the month in which Angel Jibrael revealed the Qur’an to the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), who was reflecting in the Cave of Hira. The first five verses of Surah Al-Alaq were revealed, which hold great importance to Muslims. The translation of these verses is, ‘Recite in the name of your Lord who created. Created man from a clinging substance. Recite, and your Lord is the most generous. Who taught by the pen. Taught man that which he knew not.’</p><p>There are a number of hadiths mentioning Ramadan which show its significance, such as, “When Ramadan enters, the gates of Paradise are opened, the gates of Hellfire are closed and the devils are chained.” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</p><h2><strong>What are the Spiritual Benefits of Fasting during Ramadan?</strong></h2><p>One spiritual benefit of fasting during Ramadan is that it increases a person’s Taqwa. This refers to awareness of Allah (SWT), and this is important to ensure one takes care in their endeavours in order to please Allah (SWT).</p><p>Fasting during Ramadan is also a way of investing in our Akhira (afterlife). Fasting holds great rewards, especially when done so with pure intentions. There are eight gates to Jannah, one of which is Ar-Rayyan, which will only be entered by those who fasted in this life for the sake of Allah (SWT).</p><h2><strong>What are the Health Benefits of Fasting during Ramadan?</strong></h2><p>There are several health benefits of fasting during Ramadan. Fasting improves the digestive system and flushes out toxins from the body. Therefore, while fasting spiritually cleanses the soul, fasting also physically cleanses the body from toxins. Fasting also reduces stress, prevents life-long illnesses like cancer, improves mood and increases alertness, as well as having many other benefits.</p><h2><strong>When is Ramadan 2023?</strong></h2><p>Ramadan 2023 is expected to begin on Wednesday 22 March, and end on Saturday 22 April. These dates may slightly change depending on the sighting of the moon.</p><h2><strong>What To Do in Ramadan</strong></h2><p>During Ramadan, make the most of this month by increasing forms of worship while reducing sins. This month holds a lot of rewards as well as the physical and spiritual benefits of fasting. Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: Every action a son of Adam does shall be multiplied—a good action by ten times its value, up to 700 times. Allah says: With the exception of fasting, which belongs to Me, and I reward it accordingly... (Al-Bukhari)</p><p>In addition to increasing worship during Ramadan, one should also give more generously to charity.

  "title": "Climate Change",
  "content": "<p>On 19 July 2022, we saw temperatures soar to a record-breaking 40.2°C in some areas of the UK. Prior to this, the hottest temperature recorded was 38.7°C, which is an already pretty unbearable temperature when considering the insulation of UK infrastructure that traps heat. If we use London as a marker, the average temperature sits at around 17.8°C in July, which only shows the severity of the climate change problem. Temperatures that exceed 35°C aren’t normal for the UK, and the country isn’t built in a way that’s equipped to handle such extreme heat.</p><p>“Exceptional” heatwaves, such as the most recent one, are products of climate change, and this is a very real and concerning issue. As a result, we must take actions to reduce climate change; otherwise, we run the risk of increased flooding, more erosion from storms, sea-level rise, and much more.</p><h2><strong>Is Climate Change Already Affecting UK Heatwaves?</strong></h2><p>In a word, yes. Every heatwave that occurs is made more probable, regular, and extreme by climate change. In fact, a study was carried out in relation to the previous record-breaking heatwave in which temperatures hit 38.7°C. The results of the study found that temperatures could have been up to 3°C cooler if the climate wasn’t changing.</p><p>Although we’ve experienced the effects of climate change in the UK recently, this is by no means a national issue. On the contrary, climate change is a global problem, as demonstrated by the heatwave that occurred in 2021 across the US and Canada, whereby scientists discovered that it would be virtually impossible to reach such temperatures if the global temperature wasn’t increasing.</p><h2><strong>How Does Climate Change Affect Heatwaves?</strong></h2><p>Since the industrial revolution, the average global temperature has increased by as much as 1.2°C due to human activity. Perhaps the most detrimental human activity is the burning of fossil fuels, which results in greenhouse gases being trapped in the atmosphere, causing the global temperature to rise. Due to this rise, naturally occurring hot periods are amplified, resulting in regular heatwaves of extreme temperatures.</p><p>Although 1.2°C may not sound like a lot, you’d be surprised by just how much of a difference a degree makes. For instance, in humans, if your body temperature is 1.1°C above your normal temperature, this is considered a severe fever; any higher than this could result in life-threatening consequences.</p><p>On top of the rising global temperature itself, climate change can also result in drier soil conditions. Consequently, the sun’s energy is invested into heating the ground and air, as opposed to evaporating water, which only contributes to the heat.</p><p>Similarly, global positioning also affects how a region reacts to climate change. For example, Africa is warming up faster than the global average, and other areas can also be affected by this. As a result, the heat is made to feel more intense.</p><h2><strong>What Are the Consequences of More Heatwaves?</strong></h2><p>Many people underestimate the power of heat, but extreme temperatures can, and have, killed thousands of people. In 2021 alone, the unprecedented hot weather in the UK saw 3,000 people die. Due to intense coldness being the number one weather killer of people in the UK, the concern for heat fatalities is often overlooked. Despite this, in the absence of measures to combat climate change, heatwaves are likely to become the most dangerous natural hazard.</p><p>On a less severe scale, an increased number of heatwaves means that education, work, health services, and travel will undergo disruption. Additionally, wildfires will also become more likely.</p><h2><strong>What About the Future?</strong></h2><p>Currently, we are doing more to contribute to than fight against climate change, meaning that heatwaves are set to worsen and become more regular. Although seeing temperatures exceed 40°C in the UK is still a rarity, the likelihood of it reoccurring has increased. If climate change combat initiatives aren’t implemented, these temperatures could occur every three to four years in the UK.</p><p>Everyone can do their bit to limit rising global temperatures; however, the biggest affecting bodies are large industries. Therefore, in order to limit rising global temperatures, the world would need to take action on emissions in line with the international Paris Agreement, in which temperature rises would be limited to 1.5°C or 2°C above pre-industrial levels. In terms of the UK, this means its legal target to cut emissions to net zero by 2050 must be delivered.</p><p>Furthermore, we must accept the inevitable rise in heatwaves and adapt the country to deal with such. For instance, houses will need to be built with sufficient ventilation and shading, while cities will require more trees and green space to provide these environments with shade.</p><h2><strong>What Does This Mean for Muslim Aid?</strong></h2><p>Here at Muslim Aid, we deliver aid across the globe, and many of the communities we work with are already struggling with natural hazards. In the wake of climate change, this issue is only set to worsen, making our work more vital now than ever.

  "title": "The Sacred Month of Muharram",
  "content": "<p>Muharram is one of the most important months in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.muslimaid.org/media-centre/blog/meaning-of-the-islamic-months/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(87, 120, 40);\">Islamic calendar</a>, commencing the start of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.muslimaid.org/media-centre/blog/virtues-and-blessings-for-the-islamic-new-year/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(87, 120, 40);\">new Islamic year</a>. This month is also known as Muharram-ul-Haram, and the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) referred to it as ‘the Sacred Month of Allah’. It is an extremely important and blessed month for multiple reasons, as we’ll explain below</p><h3><strong>What is Muharram?</strong></h3><p>The highly blessed month of Muharram is one of the four sacred months outlined by Allah (SWT) and is of particular significance - warfare is absolutely forbidden. Its importance is suggested by its name, with ‘Muharram’ literally translating to ‘forbidden’.</p><p>‘Indeed, the number of months with Allah is 12 [lunar] months in the register of Allah [from] the day He created the heavens and the earth; of these, four are sacred. That is the correct religion [i.e., way], so do not wrong yourselves during them. And fight against the disbelievers collectively as they fight against you collectively. And know that Allah is with the righteous [who fear Him]’. – Holy Quran (9:36).</p><p>Every single deed, whether it be good or bad, is weighed at a heavier weight on the scales during this month, so all Muslims should try to be better. Muharram is significant because Allah (SWT) designated it as one of the four sacred months of the year; however, many Muslims observe it to commemorate the death of Prophet Muhammad’s (PBUH) grandsons. Given this month is a sacred month, many Muslims fast during Muharram to increase their worship.</p><p>Allah (SWT) commands us to look after ourselves and prevent the action of wronging during this significant month. This means that we should avoid engaging in wrongful and sinful actions and, instead, have pure intentions and perform righteous deeds, and worship Allah (SWT).</p><h3><strong>Notable Muharram Events</strong></h3><p>There are a number of notable events that have occurred across the month of Muharram, with two of the most prominent being:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.muslimaid.org/media-centre/blog/what-is-the-day-of-ashura/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(87, 120, 40);\">The Day of Ashura</a></li><li>Battle of Karbala</li></ul><h3><strong>The Day of Ashura</strong></h3><p>The Day of Ashura marks the day on which the Prophet Musa (Moses) (AS) and the Israelites were saved by Allah (SWT) from the Pharaoh by splitting the Red Sea, which they passed through.</p><p>The other significant event which occurred on the Day of Ashura was when Prophet Nuh (Noah) (AS) finally left the Ark.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.muslimaid.org/appeals/muharram/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(213, 16, 81); color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><strong>Give This Muharram</strong></a></p><h3><strong>Fasting on The Day of Ashura</strong></h3><p>The practice of fasting on Ashura was known even before the rise of Islam. When the Prophet (S.A.W.) arrived in Madinah at the time of migration, the Jews were observing the fast on 'Ashura' and they said: \"This is the day when Moses became victorious over Pharaoh.\" On that, the Prophet (S.A.W.) said to his companions (R.A.): \"You (Muslims) have more right to celebrate Moses' victory than they have, so observe the fast on this day.\" (Sahih Bukhari: 4680)</p><p>When different Companions (R.A.) told Prophet (S.A.W.) that fasting on the Day of Ashura is glorified among Jews and Christians, then Prophet (S.A.W.) encouraged them by saying: “If I live until next year, I will fast the ninth day (of Muharram) too.” (Ibn Majah: 1736)</p><p>Unfortunately, the Prophet (S.A.W.) did not live to see the next year. Therefore, Muslims consider the 9th and 10th of Muharram as significant days in the Islamic calendar and observe fast on these days. [Sahih Muslim: 1134 (a)]</p><p>In the light of the Hadith, it is recommended but not mandatory that the fast of the 10th of Muharram should be attached with another fast preferably on the 9th of Muharram. This was because Prophet Mohammad (S.A.W.) wanted to distinguish the Islamic way of fasting from that of Jews as they only fast on the 10th of Muharram. Most scholars agree that the fast of Ashura should be observed with fasting on the 9th or 11th of Muharram, but it is also acceptable to fast just on the 10th.</p><p>Earlier on, it was obligatory to fast on the 10th of Muharram. However, later, fasting was made obligatory in Ramadan only, and fasting on the 10th Muharram was made optional. As narrated by Aisha (R.A.) that the Prophet (S.A.W.) said: “Whoever wishes to fast (on the day of ‘Ashura’) may do so; and whoever wishes to leave it can do so.” (Sahih Bukhari: 1592)</p><p>However, the Prophet (S.A.W.) used to fast on the Day of Ashura even after fasting in Ramadan was made obligatory.</p><p>When Ibn Abbas (R.A.) was asked about observing the fast on the Day of Ashura, he said: “I do not know Allah's Messenger (S.A.W.) singling out any day's fast and considering it more excellent than another, except this day (the Day of Ashura) and this month, meaning the month of Ramadan.” [Sahih Muslim: 1132 (a)]</p><p>So, fasting on the day of ’Ashura' is a confirmed Sunnah of the Prophet (S.A.W.) and makes one entitled to a great reward from Allah (SWT)</p><p>According to a Sahih Hadith, one of the many blessings of Allah for a person who observes fast on ‘Day of Ashura’ is that their sins of the past year will be forgiven.</p><p>Narrated by Abu Qatada (R.A.) that the Prophet (S.A.W.) said: “Fasting the day of ‘Ashura’, I hope, will expiate for the sins of the previous year.” (Ibn Majah: 1738)</p><p>The Hadith clearly mentions the word of the Prophet (S.A.W) as “I hope”, which means that the person should observe the fast wholeheartedly for Allah (SWT) only and seek reward from Allah (SWT) only and, Insha’Allah, Allah (SWT) almighty will reward that person by forgiving his sins that he committed in the previous year.</p><h3><strong>Battle of Karbala</strong></h3><p>The Battle of Karbala occurred on 10 October 680 AD in the city of Karbala, Iraq. It was between the army of the second Umayyad dynasty, Caliph Yazid I, and the family and followers of Imam Husayn Ibn Ali, the beloved grandson of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).</p><p>Upon reaching Karbala on the third day of Muharram, Imam Husayn established a camp. He was faced with a large army of around 4,000 men, commanded under Umar Ibn Saad, the son of the founder of Kufah. On the seventh day of Muharram, upon Yazid I’s orders, Imam Husayn, his family, and companions were banned from accessing water, causing them to become weak and leading to the death of many.</p><p>On the 10th day of Muharram, called Ashura, both parties assumed a position of battle and engaged in a brutal battle, during which Imam Husayn was ruthlessly martyred along with many of his family and followers.</p><h3><strong>Why is Muharram Sacred?</strong></h3><p>Muharram is a sacred month in Islam no matter what sect you follow and what events you observe because, first and foremost, Allah (SWT) declared it as one of the four sacred months, so all Muslims must observe it with respect and good practice.</p><p>It is a time to engage in devout worship and remembrance of Allah (SWT), glorifying him. Muslims should use this time to improve their spirituality and refrain from sinning with the aim of becoming a better Muslim and pleasing Allah (SWT).</p><h3><strong>When is Muharram 2022?</strong></h3><p>This year, depending on the moon, the month of Muharram is expected to start in the evening of Friday 29 July, with Ashura expected to fall on 8 or 9 August.</p><h3><strong>Make the Most of Muharram</strong></h3><p>As mentioned, all deeds – both good and bad – have a greater weight during this month. This means any acts of generosity will incur additional benefits for you. You can reap the rewards of this sacred month and help someone in need by donating to Muslim Aid&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.muslimaid.org/appeals/muharram/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(87, 120, 40);\">here</a>.</p><p>The Muslim Aid team hopes that Allah (SWT) makes the new Islamic year prosperous and productive for the Muslim community.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

  "title": "How to Celebrate Eid ul-Adha",
  "content": "<p>Because of the pandemic, how we celebrate and mark even the most sacred of festivals has been far from normal by account of social restrictions. Muslim families relied on video calls and other forms of communication to stay connected to mark&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.muslimaid.org/what-we-do/religious-dues/qurbani/eid-ul-adha/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(87, 120, 40);\"><strong>Eid ul-Adha</strong></a>&nbsp;in 2020/21 and, while it was great that we could at least see our loved ones in some form at the height of a global pandemic, it just wasn’t the same.</p><p>Eid ul-Adha 2022, hopefully, looks set to be much different, with all social restrictions being completely removed. This means families will be able to gather inside their homes with no need to worry about how many people are attending.</p><h3><strong>Hajj Pilgrimage for UK Muslims</strong></h3><p>Since restrictions have eased, UK Muslims should be permitted to enter Saudi Arabia as long as all regulations surrounding COVID-19 are followed.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Celebrating Without Restrictions</strong></h3><p>Since we are in the fortunate position where social restrictions are lifted, Muslims living in England can celebrate Qurbani Eid as they would do any other year. Family gatherings are back on the table both in and outdoors, as is the exchanging of food and gifts.</p><p>It is tradition to visit friends and family over the days of Eid, but not before completing morning prayers. As we were unable to come together in 2020/21, there is little doubt that many will choose to make the most of Eid 2022 in the UK.</p><h3><strong>Celebrating With Restrictions</strong></h3><p>In light of the lifted restrictions, families and friends can meet inside and outdoors. This will likely mean there won't be the need for video calling loved ones so they are part of festivities. That being said, should more restrictions be put in place, video calls will still come in handy for keeping relatives connected who live on opposite sides of borders.</p><p>Whether celebrating with or without restrictions, what is most important is that we remember the meaning of Eid and the giving of Qurbani. We must never forget the sacrifice that Ibrahim (AS) was willing to make for Allah (SWT).</p><h3><strong>Donate Qurbani</strong></h3><p>As part of the festival of the sacrifice, it is obligatory to donate shares of Qurbani meat to those who are most in need. Traditionally, Muslims would be expected to carry out the sacrifice themselves, with three equal shares of meat going to the person making the sacrifice, to friends or family, and to the needy.</p><p>Due to domestic laws stipulating only registered slaughterhouses are permitted to slaughter animals, Muslims in the UK can fulfil their Qurbani by donating to a charity such as Muslim Aid. We urge you to make your donation as soon as possible, allowing our team of volunteers ample time to complete the sacrifice and distribute meat over the days of Eid ul-Adha.</p><p>You can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.muslimaid.org/donate/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(87, 120, 40);\"><strong>donate for Qurbani</strong></a>&nbsp;through our website today.</p><ul><li><br></li></ul><p><br></p>",

  "title": "The Significance of Qurbani",
  "content": "<p>In the religion of Islam, the 12th and final month of the Islamic (lunar) year is Dhul Hijjah, which is an incredibly holy and sacred time. It is the month in which two significant events are observed: Qurbani and Eid al-Adha (sometimes called ‘big Eid’ or ‘greater Eid’). The two events are closely linked due to their consecutive timing.</p><p>Eid al-Adha is a three-day celebration that is not too dissimilar to Eid al-Fitr. It is a time for families and friends to come together, exchange gifts, eat food and pray together. Like Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha is a celebration for completing a religious duty. In the case of Eid al-Fitr, the religious duty is Ramadan, and with Eid al-Adha, it is Qurbani.</p><h2><strong>The History of Qurbani</strong></h2><p>Qurbani is, as mentioned, a highly religious time. The story of Qurbani begins with the Prophet Ibrahim (AS).</p><p>The Qurbani Eid story recounts that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.al-islam.org/stories-prophets/sacrifice-prophet-ibrahim\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(145, 184, 67);\"><strong>Prophet Ibrahim (AS) had a dream</strong></a>, not once, but repeatedly where he was being asked by Allah (SWT) to sacrifice his son Ismail (AS). This was a test of love and submission towards Allah. He surrendered to Allah’s (SWT) command without hesitating and prepared himself and his son for sacrifice.</p><p>It is said that Prophet Ibrahim (AS) took his son to Mount Arafat to perform the sacrifice. He described his dream to his son upon reaching the mountain, to which his son obliged and echoed the same beliefs that this was an act of obedience towards Allah (SWT).</p><p>However, as he tied his son with a rope and was about to slaughter him, Allah (SWT) replaced Ismail (AS) with a ram, and Prophet Ibrahim (AS) slaughtered the animal instead. His son Ismail (AS) was standing perfectly fine right next to him, much to his disbelief.</p><h2><strong>How Muslims Give Qurbani</strong></h2><p>On the 10th day of Dhul Hijjah, Muslims all over the world perform the act of Qurbani where they slaughter an animal and celebrate the wonderful occasion of Eid al-Adha. They celebrate this devotion and belief of Prophet Ibrahim (AS) and Ismail (AS).</p><p>Every Muslim who is of age and who has the means to do so must give Qurbani, and when they sacrifice the animal, they must do so in adherence to the following rules:</p><ul><li>Sheep and goats must be at least one year old</li><li>Cows and buffalos must be at least two years old</li><li>Camels must be at least five years old</li></ul><p>In addition, all Qurbani animals must be in good health and must not:</p><ul><li>Be blind (missing a third of their sight or more), or missing an eye</li><li>Be missing half or more of their teeth</li><li>Be underweight/thin/lean</li><li>Be lame/limping (they need to be able to walk to the place of sacrifice themselves)</li><li>Have horns that are broken at the root</li></ul><p>As well as the above rules, there are rules about how a Muslim should sacrifice an animal in order to give Qurbani. They must ensure:</p><ul><li>The slaughter knife is sharp so that unnecessary pain and suffering is avoided (it cannot be sharpened in front of the animal)</li><li>No animal is slaughtered in front of another Qurbani animal</li><li>They are at least present for the sacrifice if they do not have the knowhow to do it themselves</li><li>They say the words “Bismillah, wa Allahu Akbar” at the time of the slaughter</li><li>The animal is not skinned until it is entirely cold</li></ul><p>As time has gone on and Muslims have spread far and wide across the globe, it is not always possible for them to sacrifice an animal in the name of Qurbani, nor might it be possible for them to be present at the time of slaughter. In such instances, it is common for Muslims to give Qurbani through a charity like Muslim Aid. We use your Qurbani donation to purchase an animal and sacrifice it in your name to please Allah (SWT). The meat is then given to those most in need so that they may enjoy the Eid al-Adha celebrations with their brothers and sisters around the world.</p><h2><strong>Why Do We Have to Give Qurbani?</strong></h2><p>The Qurbani story is a remarkable illustration of unconditional love and commitment. It speaks volumes of faith and devotion towards the Almighty, in every sense. It represents Prophet Ibrahim’s (AS) and Ismail’s unmatched loyalty and fervour towards their religion and their Creator.</p><p>The significance of Qurbani in Islam holds great value and is an act of devotion towards Allah (SWT), but it is also an act of giving to others in their time of need. Traditionally, an animal that is slaughtered for Qurbani is divided into three shares: one share for the donor and their family, one share for the donor’s friends, and one share for someone in need.</p><p>You can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.muslimaid.org/qurbani/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(145, 184, 67);\"><strong>give Qurbani</strong></a><strong style=\"color: rgb(145, 184, 67);\">&nbsp;</strong>in the UK via Muslim Aid this Qurbani Eid 2022.</p>",

  "title": "What Can I Do to Help End Poverty?",
  "content": "<p>We’re all aware of the struggles that people are facing across the globe, but what can we do to stop poverty in the world? There are so many small changes that we can all be making to help alleviate poverty. Though the solutions to poverty aren’t always clear-cut, there are so many simple ways to prevent poverty. The smallest behavioural changes and financial contributions make all the difference to someone in need. Here’s how to lessen poverty.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Break The Guilt Cycle</strong></h3><p>The first step to ending poverty is breaking the guilt cycle. We’re all aware of the state of poverty in the world and hear about it almost every day. Despite this, many of us cease to do anything about it. Whether we see people begging in the street and decide to disregard them or ignore various charitable campaigns, the point is that people in need are being snubbed on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p><p>In order to make a difference, we shouldn’t feel quiet guilt, we should instead take accountability. Even if you give some food to someone begging or donate the smallest amount of change to an organisation, you can say that you did something. If everyone took small steps such as these, we could make giant leaps as a community.</p><h3><strong>Spare Some Change</strong></h3><p>We all seem to manage to save up our change to treat ourselves to something nice, but what about using that change to do something nice for someone who really needs it? Giving someone in need a pound or two may not seem like a lot, but if everyone did this, they’d be able to collect a considerable amount of money.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, it only takes a matter of pence to clothe or feed one person each day. Many of us are even privileged enough to see loose change as an inconvenience, but someone in poverty finds great value in the smallest amounts. Give your change to someone who will truly appreciate it to help eradicate poverty.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Sponsor a Child</strong></h3><p>Using the Muslim Aid website, you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.muslimaid.org/what-we-do/child-sponsorship-with-muslim-aid/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(87, 120, 40);\"><strong>sponsor a child</strong></a>&nbsp;for £420 per year. This equates to as little as £35 a month which could make a life-changing difference to a child in need. In order to reach their full potential, children need to be given the right support, including suitable education and a protected environment. Measures such as these ensure that children’s aspirations aren’t limited by poverty, providing them with proper healthcare, early learning opportunities, skills training, financial support, and generational growth.&nbsp;</p><p>Childhood is supposed to be a time of freedom and fun; however, this isn’t the case for millions of children across the globe. Instead, they are tormented by poverty, hunger, and homelessness. You can help innocent children fight against these struggles through sponsorship.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Contribute to Our Zakat or Sadaqah Appeals</strong></h3><p>Here at Muslim Aid, we can use your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.muslimaid.org/appeals/zakat/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(87, 120, 40);\"><strong>Zakat donations</strong></a>&nbsp;to alleviate poverty, strengthen healthcare, quench thirst, and relieve hunger. We promise to provide shelter to displaced people, deliver life-saving operations and emergency medical aid to those who need it, give access to sanitation and water to those in the midst of famine and drought, and help children and widows living in extreme poverty. Your Zakat isn’t solely about fulfilling your obligation; you should also ensure that it reaches its full potential to provide aid to someone in need.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite this, it’s also vital that we voluntarily assist someone in need through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.muslimaid.org/sadaqah/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(87, 120, 40);\"><strong>Sadaqah donations</strong></a>. Acts of kindness such as these can completely transform the lives of those who are struggling. Like Zakat donations, we put your Sadaqah donations towards our established aid chain to help alleviate the struggles faced by those living in poverty.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Clean Out Your Pantry</strong></h3><p>We’re all guilty of hoarding tins of food and other non-perishable goods. It’s a privilege to be able to forget about food, as this is all a hungry individual can think about. Your forgotten food could be what stops someone from going hungry.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll be able to find a local food bank with a little bit of research, so box up your non-perishables and donate them. Hunger in the UK is much more common than you’d believe and is worsening with the rising cost of living. Everyone deserves to be nourished and there is more than enough food in the world to make this happen. Clean out your pantry and feed the hungry.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Clean Out Your Wardrobe</strong></h3><p>Another thing that we all find ourselves doing is refusing to get rid of clothes that we clearly never wear. However, some people have to make do with only one of each clothing item. Not only is this unhygienic, but it’s also painfully uncomfortable. Whether you donate locally or send your spare clothing overseas, there’s someone out there who desperately needs the clothes that you don’t wear.&nbsp;</p><p>In some countries, bras are a sign of wealth, meaning that women and girls who wear bras aren’t as susceptible to abuse. Consider shipping your bras to foundations that tackle this issue so that women are provided with a layer of protection.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Buy Fair Trade Products</strong></h3><p>By purchasing fair trade products, you support a sustainable trade system that ensures workers are paid fairly. Consequently, poor communities are able to sustainably develop and are provided with the opportunity to tackle generational poverty without relying on aid organisations.&nbsp;</p>",

  "title": "CityTech2023 – Transforming Education through Technology",
  "content": "<p>Educational technology merges humanities and technology to not only create new learning experiences but to increase accessibility to modern education. It is no wonder therefore that EdTech has swept across the world.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p>Up-to-date computer labs or classroom desk-based computer devices are the norms in City Schools and in all modern schools these days. Their students feel completely at home with computer technology and invariably they are keen to increase their knowledge and skills with this major change in educational institutions.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\">It is unsurprising therefore that the CityTech2023 conference was a resounding success.</p><p>Held on March 18, 2023, at The City School PAF Chapter, Karachi, the conference highlighted the impact of technology on education and brought together educators, technologists, and industry leaders to discuss their knowledge and insights into how technology is gradually transforming education.</p><p>However, is the ever-expanding and, for the developers, financially highly profitable world of EdTech in today’s schools really all that rosy? The conference speakers overwhelmingly agreed that learning outcomes are what determine the success of the programs.</p><p>It is not the technology itself but the outcomes of technology that is the issue. Keynote speaker Dr. Kevin Martin, Centre Manager of Cambridge University’s ‘Digital Education Futures Initiative’ (DEFI) emphasized that unless relationships and dialogue are central to the learning process and experience, learning will not be as efficient as it should be.</p><p><br></p><p>Internationally, the recent covid crisis brought this out clearly.</p><p><img src=\"https://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/WhatsApp-Image-2023-03-28-at-2.26.29-PM.jpeg\" height=\"1066\" width=\"1600\"></p><p>A lack of infrastructure was not the only problem. If engagement and dialogue are missing, learning outcomes will be deficient. Dr. Martin went on to say that EdTech must be focused on quality transformational experiences; that teachers must be a part of the process of designing EdTech interventions, and teacher training must be teacher-centric to make training work for teachers.</p><p>Another keynote guest speaker, Mr. Rob Jamieson, Head of Partnerships at Pearsons School Qualifications, concurred: EdTech is “a servant, not a master”, he said. Teachers must be guided by their subject expertise and not be overwhelmed by the claims of individual programs.</p><p>Mr. Khan Kashif Khan, Director of Strategy and Operations at The City School Southern Region, when asked to share his vision and thoughts on EdTech said:</p><p><br></p><p>“Digital technology has made the entire educational process faster, more efficient, and more interactive than previously. Students are learning faster, staying engaged, and retaining more with well-made virtual lessons and they are enjoying entire individual and group projects so it’s no surprise that students learn faster.”</p><p>Mr. Khan, in common with all the conference speakers, advises schools to incorporate technology into their curriculum as a necessary step.</p><p>“It’s no longer a matter of choice but a crucial responsibility. The goal must be to prepare students for a world that is continuously changing, and technology is an essential component of that preparation. Without technology, students may not be equipped to handle the demands of the modern world which may leave them irrelevant.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Therefore, it is essential to make technology integration a priority and to continuously explore and incorporate new technologies to ensure that students are adequately prepared.”</p><p>The City School’s key strategy is to collaborate closely with major technology partners such as Microsoft and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://propakistani.pk/price/brand/google/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(36, 153, 145);\">Google</a>&nbsp;to develop solutions. The goal is to bring about a fundamental shift in the means of delivering education programs. In other words, the conference was not about imparting new skills but about driving a broader transformation in education.</p><p>The City School prioritizes ensuring that teachers and staff are properly trained and equipped to use technology effectively in their classrooms. Technology is not limited to just the ICT curriculum but covers every aspect of teaching and learning. Therefore, all teachers and staff are exposed to it, regardless of their subject area.</p><p><br></p><p>Additionally, The City School invests in its infrastructure to make technology easy to use, which means that teachers don’t need to be ICT experts. Instead, an enabling environment is provided that makes it straightforward to integrate technology into their teaching.</p><p>Quoting Jack Ma, Mr Jamieson said that we are step by step moving from knowledge-based education to computer-based education.</p><p><br></p>",

  "content": "<p>The Idara-e-Taleem-o-Aagahi (ITA) has launched its annual report on constituency-based education mapping for the year 2022, with a focus on NA-171, NA-232, NA-11, and NA-42 in Pakistan.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p>The report, known as the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), is one of the largest surveys on education in the country.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p>The ASER report provides reliable and independent estimates on the state of education in Pakistan, with a particular emphasis on enrolment numbers, learning levels of children, school facilities, and household indicators that impact learning and its quality. It is an essential tool for policymakers, researchers, and educators looking to understand the current state of education and identify areas for improvement.</p><p><br></p><p>The launch event for the report was held on Tuesday in Bahawalpur and attracted a range of attendees, including eminent educationists, policymakers, civil society members, politicians, political workers, education department bureaucrats, assistant education officers, school heads, and media CSOs. All were keen to hear about what had been promised and delivered in the past five years.</p><p>The recently launched ASER has revealed key findings on enrolment and learning levels in four Pakistani constituencies: Bahawalpur NA-171, Kohistan NA-11, Mohmand NA-42, and Thatta NA-232.</p><p>The report highlights variations in enrolment levels across the constituencies, with Bahawalpur NA-171 showing the highest enrolment rate at 65% for children aged between 5 and 16 years. Kohistan NA-11 followed with 62%, Mohmand NA-42 with 61%, and Thatta&nbsp;NA-232 with 53%.</p><p><br></p><p>The report also shows that girls are lagging behind boys in all constituencies, with the largest gaps at elementary and secondary levels. More than 30% of girls are out-of-school at the secondary level, with Kohistan having an alarming percentage of 60% of girls out of school at this level. Mohmand shows a particularly high proportion of out-of-school girls, with 37% not enrolled in school.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p>In terms of learning outcomes, Bahawalpur NA-171 has the highest proportion of students with consistently higher learning levels, with 45.4% of students able to read a story in Urdu/Sindhi/Pashto, 49.4% able to read a story in English, and 46.5% able to do division. However, the percentage of students achieving these levels is still less than 50%. In contrast, Thatta has the lowest learning levels, with less than 20% of students being above beginner level in each competency.</p><p>The report also shows that private school students in all constituencies, except Kohistan NA-11, exhibited higher learning levels than those enrolled in public schools.</p><p><br></p><p>For grade 5, public schools in Bahawalpur NA-171 displayed the highest levels of learning, with 72% of public school students able to read a story in Urdu/Sindhi/Pashto, 61% able to read sentences in English, and 66% able to perform 2-digit division. In contrast, only 33% of public school students in Thatta can read a story in Urdu/Sindhi/Pashto.</p><p>The report launch event saw participants discuss the findings and offer their insights on the way forward. Representatives from the four constituencies promised to work towards improving girls’ education, initiating enrolment drives, and improving the quality of education.</p><p><br></p>",

  "content": "<p>Lamborghini has finally unveiled the successor to the iconic and massively popular Aventador supercar.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p>Dubbed ‘Revuelto’, the new supercar debuts as a part of the Italian car maker’s iconic flagship lineup that includes names like Miura, Countach, Diablo, Murcielago, and Aventador.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><h2><strong>Looks</strong></h2><p>Revuelto combines decades-old styling cues with some modern ones to make for a unique and sharp-looking supercar. It has Diablo’s raised rear end and Murcielago’s hunkered-down and long nose. The car also maintains Countach’s scissor doors and wedge shape.</p><p><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p><img src=\"https://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Revuelto-2.jpg\" height=\"653\" width=\"980\"></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\">ALSO READ</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><a href=\"https://propakistani.pk/2023/03/30/price-hike-chery-tiggo-8-pro-breaks-rs-1-crore-barrier/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(203, 41, 1);\">Price Hike: Chery Tiggo 8 Pro Breaks Rs. 1 Crore Barrier</a></p><p>The new design elements include horizontal Y-shaped DRLs in front, similar to Sian, as well as Y-shaped LED taillights, similar to Veneno and Centenario. The side air scoops are larger and sharper, while the two massive exhaust pipes in the back make the car look like a fighter jet.</p><p>Overall, Revuelto is, unmistakably, a Lamborghini, which is a good thing.</p><h2><strong>The Beating Heart</strong></h2><p>Unlike its predecessors, the latest generation raging bull is a plug-in hybrid. Two electric motors on the front axle and one electric motor on an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.</p><p>Amazingly, while downsized and turbocharged engines are all the rage these days — cases in point being Ferrari, Porsche, and McLaren — Lamborghini has gone whole hog in ensuring its unique and visceral supercar experience.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Revuelto-3.jpg\" height=\"653\" width=\"980\"></p><p>The Revuelto has a brand new naturally aspirated 6.5 liter V12 engine that, without the electric power, makes 814 horsepower (hp) at an eardrum-shattering 9,500 RPM. However, with the electric power assistance, the total power output reaches a whopping 1001 hp.</p><p>Lamborghini claims a 0-100 km/h acceleration time of 2.5 seconds, and a top speed of almost 350 km/h.</p><h2><strong>The Essentials</strong></h2><p>True to the Lamborghini flagship tradition, Revuelto has only two seats, very little luggage space, and a driver-centric cockpit.</p><p><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\">ALSO READ</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><a href=\"https://propakistani.pk/2023/03/29/protons-new-seven-seater-suv-will-be-a-hybrid/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(203, 41, 1);\">Proton’s New Seven-Seater SUV Will Be a Hybrid</a></p><p>The four steering wheel rotors control drive modes and additional buttons activate turn signals and launch control.
